"Şeker" Ahmed Pasha (1841–1907) was an Ottoman painter.
Born in Üsküdar, Istanbul he entered medical school in 1855, then transferred to the military academy. Here, he showed an interest in painting. Sultan Abdülaziz liked his work and sent him to Paris immediately after Süleyman Seyyid to study under Gustave Boulanger and Jean-Léon Gérôme. He had an exhibition of his oil paintings in Paris in 1869, and returned to Istanbul in 1871, with a rank of Captain.
In 1873, he organized one of the first painting exhibits in Istanbul. "Şeker" Ahmed Pasha advanced in the ranks quickly, in 1876 being promoted to Major, in 1877 to Lieutenant Colonel, in 1880 to Colonel, in 1885 to Brigadier General, and in 1890 to Lieutenant General. In 1896 he became responsible for Protocol.
"Şeker" Ahmed Pasha is one of the most important examples of the Ottoman military painters. He painted nature-related subjects such as forests, fruits, flowers, and animals with great skill.
He died in 1907 of a heart attack, and is buried in Eyup Sultan Cemetery in Istanbul.
