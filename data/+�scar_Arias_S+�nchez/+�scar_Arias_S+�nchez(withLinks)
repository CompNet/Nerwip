Raised by an <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">upper class</a> family in the province of <a href="/wiki/Heredia_Province" title="Heredia Province">Heredia</a>, Óscar Arias concluded his secondary schooling at the Saint Francis College in the capital city of <a href="/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9, _Costa_Rica" title="San José, Costa Rica">San José</a>. He then went to the United States and enrolled in <a href="/wiki/Boston_University" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> with the intention of studying <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, but he soon returned to his home country and completed degrees in <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Costa_Rica" title="University of Costa Rica">University of Costa Rica</a>. In 1967, Arias traveled to the United Kingdom and enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Economics" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a>. He received a doctoral degree in <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Essex" title="University of Essex">University of Essex</a> in 1974. Arias has received over fifty honorary degrees, including doctorates from <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oberlin_College" title="Oberlin College">Oberlin College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wake_Forest_University" title="Wake Forest University">Wake Forest University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ithaca_College" title="Ithaca College">Ithaca College</a> and <a href="/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis" title="Washington University in St. Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>.
Arias joined the <a href="/wiki/National_Liberation_Party_(Costa_Rica)" title="National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)">National Liberation Party</a> (PLN), Costa Rica's main <a href="/wiki/Social_democracy" title="Social democracy">social democratic</a> party. In 1986 he ran successfully for president on that party's ticket. Arias's presidency saw the transformation of Costa Rica's economy from one based on the traditional <a href="/wiki/Cash_crop" title="Cash crop">cash crops</a> (<a href="/wiki/Coffee" title="Coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Banana" title="Banana">bananas</a>) to one more focused on non-traditional agriculture (e.g., of exotic flowers and <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Tourism" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. Some within the PLN criticized his administration for abandoning the party's social democratic teachings and promoting a <a href="/wiki/Neoliberal" title="Neoliberal" class="mw-redirect">neoliberal</a> economic model. He is now often regarded as a neoliberal although he is a member of a nominally social democratic party.
Arias received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize with the help of John Biehl, his peer in England, and Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto for his work towards the signing of the <a href="/wiki/Esquipulas_Peace_Agreement" title="Esquipulas Peace Agreement">Esquipulas II Accords</a>. This was a plan intended to promote <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and peace on the Central American <a href="/wiki/Isthmus" title="Isthmus">isthmus</a> during a time of great turmoil: leftist guerrillas were fighting against the governments in <a href="/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War" title="Salvadoran Civil War">El Salvador</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guatemalan_Civil_War" title="Guatemalan Civil War">Guatemala</a>, which were backed by the United States under the auspices of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Contras" title="Contras">Contras</a>, supported by the United States , were fighting an insurgency against the <a href="/wiki/Sandinista" title="Sandinista" class="mw-redirect">Sandinista</a> government in <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>; <a href="/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>, only recently wresting political power from its military, was caught in the middle as a base for U.S. military forces; and on Costa Rica's other border, <a href="/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> faced the oppression of <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Noriega" title="Manuel Noriega">Manuel Noriega</a>'s military dictatorship. With the support of Arias, the various armed conflicts ended within the decade (Guatemala's civil war finally ended in 1996).
Arias then called for a higher level of integration in the Central America region and promoted the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Central_American_Parliament" title="Central American Parliament">Central American Parliament</a> (Parlamento Centroamericano). During his current administration, Arias has declared that Costa Rica will not enter the Central American Parliament. Arias also modified the country's <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Costa_Rica" title="Education in Costa Rica">educational system</a>. The most notable action in this respect was the reintroduction of standardized academic tests at the end of primary and secondary school.
The Costa Rican constitution had been amended in 1969 to include a clause which forbade former presidents seeking re-election. Arias challenged this at the Sala IV, the Constitutional Chamber of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Justice_of_Costa_Rica" title="Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica">Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica</a>, which initially rejected his application in September 2000. In 2003, a group of Arias supporters presented an unconstitutionality challenge against the 1969 constitutional amendment forbidding re-election, and this time the ruling in April 2003 struck down the prohibition against non-consecutive re-election .
Arias announced in 2004 that he intended to run again for president in the <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rican_presidential_election, _2006" title="Costa Rican presidential election, 2006" class="mw-redirect">February 2006 general elections</a>. Though for years private polling companies and several news media published polls predicting Arias would win by a wide margin, the election was initially deemed too close to call. A month later, on 7 March, after a manual recount, the official results showed Arias beat center-left contender <a href="/wiki/Ott%C3%B3n_Sol%C3%ADs" title="Ottón Solís">Ottón Solís</a> by 18, 169 votes (1.2% of valid votes cast). He took the oath of office at noon on 8 May 2006 at the National Stadium. In his speech on 15 September 2008, he admitted that he was tired because of the criticism of his opponents.
On 1 June 2007, he switched Costa Rica's diplomatic recognition from the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (Taiwan) to the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China" class="mw-redirect">People's Republic of China</a>, making Costa Rica the 167th nation in the world to do so. Subsequently, under diplomatic and financial pressure from Beijing, he induced the <a href="/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama" title="14th Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>, a fellow <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> laureate, to postpone indefinitely a proposed and much anticipated visit during Beijing's suppression of controversial riots in <a href="/wiki/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>.
At the <a href="/wiki/5th_Summit_of_the_Americas" title="5th Summit of the Americas">5th Summit of the Americas</a> in <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, on 18 April 2009, Arias gave a speech on the topic "We've been doing something wrong". Directed at fellow Latin American leaders, he decried Latin America's lack of development compared to other parts of the world, calling for pragmatism, and more resources directed at education rather than militaries. .
In 2009, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Honduras" title="Supreme Court of Honduras">Supreme Court of Honduras</a> issued an arrest warrant on <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Zelaya" title="Manuel Zelaya">Manuel Zelaya</a> because of violations of the constitution and laws. Two days later, the <a href="/wiki/National_Congress_of_Honduras" title="National Congress of Honduras">National Congress of Honduras</a> (in which Zelaya's own party held 62 out of 128 seats, more than any other party), also voted to dismiss Zelaya. Zelaya was sent to Costa Rica. The Honduran constitution mandated that the head of Congress, <a href="/wiki/Roberto_Micheletti" title="Roberto Micheletti">Roberto Micheletti</a>, who was next in the Presidential line of succession, becomes the provisional head of state since Vice President <a href="/wiki/Elvin_Ernesto_Santos" title="Elvin Ernesto Santos" class="mw-redirect">Elvin Ernesto Santos</a> had resigned in December 2008 to run for President. Micheletti’s term ended 27 January 2010.
Arias began serving as mediator between Manuel Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti in the <a href="/wiki/2009_Honduran_constitutional_crisis" title="2009 Honduran constitutional crisis">2009 Honduran constitutional crisis</a>. Representatives of the two Hondurans met with Arias on various occasions but so far have failed to reach any kind of agreement. As described above (with factual citations), Arias himself was initially prohibited by Costa Rica's constitutional court from another term, due to constitutional <a href="/wiki/Term_limit" title="Term limit">term limits</a>, but this was reversed using legal means, with the consent of the Costa Rican Sala IV court, unlike in Honduras. New elections in Honduras are planned for 29 November 2009. Micheletti's government stated on 2 July 2009 that it is willing to hold this year's presidential election early. Costa Rican President, Oscar Arias, presented a seven point agreement, which calls for the return of Zelaya as President - a condition deemed unacceptable to the interim government. Zelaya's representatives accepted the Arias proposal "in principle" but Micheletti's representatives balked at the key point of Zelaya returning to power in Honduras.
In August 2007, Arias was affected by <a href="/wiki/Tendinitis" title="Tendinitis">tendinitis</a>, and in April 2008 he canceled some activities because of muscular pain in his <a href="/wiki/Lumbar_region" title="Lumbar region" class="mw-redirect">lumbar region</a>. Subsequently, due to increasing difficulty in speaking over the course of several weeks, Arias went to the Philadelphia <a href="/wiki/Otolaryngology" title="Otolaryngology">Ears, Nose and Throat</a> Associates medical center in the United States on 20 May 2008, where it was determined that he had a nonmalignant cyst on his vocal cords. As a result, it was announced on 21 May that doctors advised him not to speak for one month, saying that if this did not help, surgery would be considered. On 11 August 2009 Arias was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/H1N1" title="H1N1" class="mw-redirect">H1N1</a> Influenza, but he overcame his disease.
