<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Ahmet DavutoÄxlu<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was granted a title of ambassador by the joint decision of President <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Ahmet Necdet Sezer<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and Prime Minister <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Abdullah GÃ¼l<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> that was made on <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>17 January 2003<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> and published in the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> dated <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>18 January 2003<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>.

Especially his book Strategic Depth is a very influential book in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Turkey<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>'s foreign policy orientation. He is very influential in the military, academic, and government triangle shaping Turkish foreign policy.
Ambassador <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>DavutoÄxlu<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was one of the leading actors on behalf of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Turkish government<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> during the shuttle diplomacy for the settlement of <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>2008<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> Israelâ¬Gaza conflict. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>DavutoÄxlu<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was appointed as the Foreign Minister of <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Turkey<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> on <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1 May 2009<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. He has since called for <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Turkey<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> to become more than just a regional power within <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Europe<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and the <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Middle East<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and desires <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Ankara<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> to have a far more influential role in world politics. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>DavutoÄxlu<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> is generally linked to the notion of Turkish neo-Ottomanism, which favours a commonwealth with its neighbours and old Ottoman connections. Although his foreign policies have been regarded as neo-Ottomanist by Western and especially <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>U.S.<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> media, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>DavutoÄxlu<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> does not accept such a characterization. He stated in an interview with Turkish daily Sabah that "as much as we don't use this conceptualization, the fact that it is being used against us is either because of misunderstanding or lack of goodwill." He argued against the idea that Turkey is trying to establish a neo-Ottoman imperial order by saying that: "I have said that Turkey as a nation-state is equal with any other nation-state of our region whether it is small in population or area. We don't have any hegemony on anyone. Rather what we are trying to do is to contribute to the establishment of a permanent peace in our region. If by order they mean is Pax Ottomana, Pax in the meaning of order, we are trying to establish a order, it is not wrong to say such thing".
He was listed by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the top 100 global thinkers of <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>2010<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> for being the brains behind <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Turkey<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>'s global reawakening. In an interview with him he talked about his "Zero Problem Policy" and said that "It is possible to have zero problems if the other actors respect our values. It doesn't mean that we will be silent in order to have good relations with all parties.".
