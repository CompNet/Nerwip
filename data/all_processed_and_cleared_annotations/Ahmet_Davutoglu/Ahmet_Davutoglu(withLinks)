Ambassador Davutoğlu was one of the leading actors on behalf of the Turkish government during the shuttle diplomacy for the settlement of <a href="/wiki/2008_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict" title="2008 Israel–Gaza conflict" class="mw-redirect">2008 Israel–Gaza conflict</a>. Davutoğlu was appointed as the Foreign Minister of Turkey on 1 May 2009. He has since called for <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> to become more than just a <a href="/wiki/Regional_power" title="Regional power">regional power</a> within <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and desires <a href="/wiki/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> to have a far more influential role in world politics. Davutoğlu is generally linked to the notion of Turkish <a href="/wiki/Neo-Ottomanism" title="Neo-Ottomanism">neo-Ottomanism</a>, which favours a commonwealth with its neighbours and old <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> connections. Although his foreign policies have been regarded as neo-Ottomanist by Western and especially U.S. media, Davutoğlu does not accept such a characterization. He stated in an interview with Turkish daily <a href="/wiki/Sabah" title="Sabah">Sabah</a> that "as much as we don't use this conceptualization, the fact that it is being used against us is either because of misunderstanding or lack of goodwill." He argued against the idea that Turkey is trying to establish a neo-Ottoman imperial order by saying that: "I have said that Turkey as a nation-state is equal with any other nation-state of our region whether it is small in population or area. We don't have any hegemony on anyone. Rather what we are trying to do is to contribute to the establishment of a permanent peace in our region. If by order they mean is <a href="/wiki/Pax_Ottomana" title="Pax Ottomana">Pax Ottomana</a>, Pax in the meaning of order, we are trying to establish a order, it is not wrong to say such thing".
He was listed by <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Policy" title="Foreign Policy">Foreign Policy</a> magazine as one of the top 100 global thinkers of 2010 for being the brains behind Turkey's global reawakening. In an interview with him he talked about his "Zero Problem Policy" and said that "It is possible to have zero problems if the other actors respect our values. It doesn't mean that we will be silent in order to have good relations with all parties.".
