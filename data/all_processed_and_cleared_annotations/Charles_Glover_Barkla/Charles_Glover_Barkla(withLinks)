Charles Glover Barkla (7 June 1877 to 23 October 1944) was a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physicist</a>, and the winner of the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1917 for his work in <a href="/wiki/X-ray_spectroscopy" title="X-ray spectroscopy">X-ray spectroscopy</a> and related areas in the study of <a href="/wiki/X-ray" title="X-ray">X-rays</a> (<a href="/wiki/Roentgen_rays" title="Roentgen rays" class="mw-redirect">Roentgen rays</a>).
Barkla was born in <a href="/wiki/Widnes" title="Widnes">Widnes</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, and he studied at the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Institute_for_Boys" title="Liverpool Institute for Boys" class="mw-redirect">Liverpool Institute</a> and at <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_University" title="Liverpool University" class="mw-redirect">Liverpool University</a>. In 1899, Barkla went to <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College, _Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, as an Exhibition Scholar to work in the <a href="/wiki/Cavendish_Laboratory" title="Cavendish Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> under the physicist <a href="/wiki/J._J._Thomson" title="J. J. Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a>. At the end of a year and a half, his love of music led him to move on to <a href="/wiki/King%27s_College, _Cambridge" title="King's College, Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, where he joined its chapel <a href="/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choir</a>. He completed his <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_arts" title="Bachelor of arts" class="mw-redirect">bachelor of arts</a> degree in 1903, and then his <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)" title="Master of Arts (postgraduate)" class="mw-redirect">Master of Arts</a> degree in 1907. No information seems to be available about when or where he earned a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) degree, but it is known that the great physicists <a href="/wiki/J.J._Thompson" title="J.J. Thompson" class="mw-redirect">J.J. Thompson</a> (the discoverer of the <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electron</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Lodge" title="Oliver Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a> were his doctoral advisors.
In 1913, after having worked at the Universities of <a href="/wiki/Cambridge" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, and <a href="/wiki/King%27s_College, _London" title="King's College, London" class="mw-redirect">King's College, London</a>, Barkla was appointed as a professor of <a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" title="Natural philosophy">natural philosophy</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>, a position that he held until his death. Barkla married Mary Esther Cowell in 1907.
Barkla made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, <a href="/wiki/X-ray_spectroscopy" title="X-ray spectroscopy">X-ray spectroscopy</a>, the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1917. He was also awarded the <a href="/wiki/Hughes_Medal" title="Hughes Medal">Hughes Medal</a> of the British <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> that same year.
Little more seems to have been recorded about the life of Charles Barkla.
The <a href="/wiki/Lunar_crater" title="Lunar crater" class="mw-redirect">lunar crater</a> <a href="/wiki/Barkla_(crater)" title="Barkla (crater)">Barkla</a> was named in the honor of Charles Barkla. Also a commemorative plaque has been installed in the vicinity of the Canongate, near the Faculty of Education Buildings, at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. Additionally, a lecture theatre at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Liverpool" title="University of Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a>'s Physics department is named after him.
