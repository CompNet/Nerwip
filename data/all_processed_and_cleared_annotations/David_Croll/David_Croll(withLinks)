Croll became a lawyer as a young man and then entered politics serving as <a href="/wiki/Mayor" title="Mayor">mayor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Windsor, _Ontario" title="Windsor, Ontario">Windsor, Ontario</a> from 1931 to 1934 during the worst days of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. He made his reputation as a social reformer when he insisted the city go into deficit in order to provide relief programs for the unemployed and destitute.
Croll won a seat in the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario" title="Legislative Assembly of Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Liberal_Party" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Liberal</a> <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly" title="Member of the Legislative Assembly">Member of the Legislative Assembly</a> (MLA) for Windsor in the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_general_election, _1934" title="Ontario general election, 1934">1934 election</a> that brought the Liberals to power under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Mitchell_Hepburn" title="Mitchell Hepburn">Mitchell Hepburn</a>. Croll became Canada's first <a href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_(government)" title="Cabinet (government)">cabinet</a> minister when he became Minister of Public Welfare. He later also added the portfolios of Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Labour. He and <a href="/wiki/Attorney-General" title="Attorney-General" class="mw-redirect">Attorney-General</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Roebuck" title="Arthur Roebuck">Arthur Roebuck</a> broke with Hepburn over the Premier's opposition to the <a href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a> strike against <a href="/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation" title="General Motors Corporation" class="mw-redirect">General Motors</a> in <a href="/wiki/Oshawa" title="Oshawa">Oshawa</a> in 1937, and resigned from cabinet saying "I would rather walk with the workers than ride with General Motors." He served in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Army" title="Canadian Army">Canadian Army</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War" class="mw-redirect">Second World War</a>, enlisting as a <a href="/wiki/Private_(rank)" title="Private (rank)">Private</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Essex_Scottish_Regiment" title="Essex Scottish Regiment" class="mw-redirect">Essex Scottish Regiment</a> and rising in rank to <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-colonel" title="Lieutenant-colonel" class="mw-redirect">lieutenant-colonel</a>. He remained a provincial Liberal backbencher until 1943, as well as serving again as Mayor of Windsor.
He was recruited by the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> to contest the <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> riding of <a href="/wiki/Spadina_(electoral_district)" title="Spadina (electoral district)">Spadina</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election, _1945" title="Canadian federal election, 1945">1945 federal election</a>. The Liberals feared that <a href="/wiki/Tim_Buck" title="Tim Buck">Tim Buck</a>, leader of the <a href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist" class="mw-redirect">communist</a> <a href="/wiki/Labour_Progressive_Party" title="Labour Progressive Party" class="mw-redirect">Labour Progressive Party</a> was poised to win the riding. The popular Croll was seen as the only Liberal who could defeat him. After Croll was nominated, Buck instead ran in a neighbouring riding, leaving <a href="/wiki/Sam_Carr" title="Sam Carr">Sam Carr</a> to be the LPP's candidate. Croll handily won a seat in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" title="Canadian House of Commons" class="mw-redirect">Canadian House of Commons</a> becoming Spadina's <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) and <a href="/wiki/Tory" title="Tory">Tory</a> Toronto's sole Liberal MP. He was re-elected in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election, _1949" title="Canadian federal election, 1949">1949</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election, _1953" title="Canadian federal election, 1953">1953 elections</a>.
Despite being regarded as one of the most talented Liberal MPs and, until 1950, the only Liberal MP from Toronto, Croll was never summoned to the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Cabinet" title="Canadian Cabinet" class="mw-redirect">Canadian Cabinet</a> where he would have become the first Jewish federal cabinet minister. <a href="/wiki/Louis_St._Laurent" title="Louis St. Laurent">Louis St. Laurent</a> admitted to Croll that this was due to <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitism" title="Anti-Semitism" class="mw-redirect">anti-Semitism</a> in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> and within quarters of the Liberal Party. Instead, he was appointed to the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" title="Canadian Senate" class="mw-redirect">Canadian Senate</a> in 1955, becoming Canada's first Jewish senator.
Croll was the author of the influential 1971 "Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty" which began with the words "the poor do not choose poverty. It is at once their affliction and our national shame. The children of the poor (and there are many) are the most helpless victims of all, and find even less hope in a society where welfare systems from the very beginning destroys their chances of a better life." The report moved the <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau" title="Pierre Trudeau">Trudeau</a> government to triple family allowances in 1973 and institute the Child Tax Credit in 1978. Aside from his work on poverty, he was also responsible for Senate reports on aging. In 1990 in recognition of his contributions, he was sworn into the <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada" title="Queen's Privy Council for Canada">Queen's Privy Council for Canada</a>, an honour usually given only to federal cabinet ministers.
He remained a senator until his death in 1991.
