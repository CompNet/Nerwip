<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>David Anthony Gerald Sumberg<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> (born <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>June 2, 1941<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Stoke-on-Trent<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Staffordshire<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>) is a <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>British<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> politician, and Member of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>European Parliament<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> for the <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>North West England<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> region for the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Conservative Party<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>. He was first elected to the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>European Parliament<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1999<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> and stood down in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>2009<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>.
He is married to <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Carolyn<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and has two grown up children, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Jonathan<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Katie<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>. In the <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1970<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>s he was a partner in a firm of <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Manchester<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> lawyers <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Maurice Rubin<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> & <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Co. Sumberg<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was previously the Member of <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Parliament<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> for <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Bury South<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, from <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1983<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> to <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1997<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>, and is a former <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Manchester City<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> Councillor. As an MP he acted as the Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Attorney General, Sir <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Patrick Mayhew<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>.
As an MEP, he said that he was "not a signed up member" of the "<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>European Project<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>" and did not support a more centralised <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>European Union<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>, "unlike most of my MEP colleagues".
He has been criticised by members of other political parties and the national media for his low attendance and political inactivity. From <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>2004<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> to <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>2008<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he made only two speeches and gave twelve explanations of votes - a total of 536 words. He has also tabled only five questions and has not written any of the reports or tabled any resolutions to the one committee he sat on. His local rival, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Chris Davies<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> MEP, said he would undoubtedly make the shortlist for <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Britain<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>'s laziest MEP. Defending himself, he said speeches in the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>European Parliament<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> did not achieve a great deal as they are to empty chambers with no-one listening.
He paid his wife £54, 000 per year from the staff allowance and claimed £40, 000 per year in office expenses; he used the <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>North West England<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Conservative Campaigns Centre<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> as a forwarding address to his house in his north London, where he claimed the expenses.
