He was educated at the Marist College in <a href="/wiki/Dundalk" title="Dundalk">Dundalk</a> and later attended <a href="/wiki/University_College_Dublin" title="University College Dublin">University College Dublin</a>. Afterwards he studied at the <a href="/wiki/Law_Society_of_Ireland" title="Law Society of Ireland">Law Society of Ireland</a> and was admitted as a <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a>. He then started a successful career as a solicitor.
Ahern currently lives in <a href="/wiki/Blackrock, _County_Louth" title="Blackrock, County Louth">Blackrock</a> near Dundalk with his wife and their two children. His pastimes include playing <a href="/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windsurfing" title="Windsurfing">windsurfing</a>. He is a former Ulster windsurfing champion. Ahern is a former chairman of Rock Celtic soccer club and was also treasurer of <a href="/wiki/Dundalk_F.C." title="Dundalk F.C.">Dundalk F.C.</a> Supporter's Club.
Ahern was born into a family that had no association with party politics. He became involved in politics at a young age and became a member of <a href="/wiki/Louth_County_Council" title="Louth County Council">Louth County Council</a> in 1979 as a <a href="/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> representative. He served on that authority until 1991. Ahern was elected to <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Irish_general_election, _1987" title="Irish general election, 1987">1987 general election</a> and has retained his seat ever since. The following year he was appointed assistant government <a href="/wiki/Chief_whip" title="Chief whip" class="mw-redirect">chief whip</a> by <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Haughey" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a>.
Three years later in 1991 the Minister for Finance, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Reynolds" title="Albert Reynolds">Albert Reynolds</a>, failed in his attempt to oust Haughey as leader. Ahern, who supported Haughey, was rewarded with the post of <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" title="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach">Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</a> with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip and <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Defence" title="Minister of State at the Department of Defence">Minister of State at the Department of Defence</a>. In February 1992 Haughey was forced to resign and Albert Reynolds became party leader and Taoiseach. Ahern became a backbencher for the entire duration of the Fianna Fáil-<a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(Ireland)" title="Labour Party (Ireland)">Labour Party</a> government.
In late 1994 <a href="/wiki/Bertie_Ahern" title="Bertie Ahern">Bertie Ahern</a> (no relation) succeeded Albert Reynolds as leader of Fianna Fáil. Ahern once again returned to the senior ranks of the party becoming chief whip. In 1997 he was sent to London to check out rumours that another senior party member, <a href="/wiki/Ray_Burke_(Irish_politician)" title="Ray Burke (Irish politician)">Ray Burke</a>, had received a payment from Joseph Murphy. The claim was denied and Burke was appointed <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" title="Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade">Minister for Foreign Affairs</a> two days later following the return to power of Fianna Fáil. Burke later served a jail sentence for corruption including the Murphy bribe. Ahern has since taken a stance on the issue of political corruption in Ireland publicly calling for an outright ban of corporate and trade union donations to political parties.
In more recent times Ahern's <a href="/wiki/Religious_beliefs" title="Religious beliefs" class="mw-redirect">religious beliefs</a> have been questioned especially in the way that his religious ideology may influence his political standpoint.
Following the <a href="/wiki/Irish_general_election, _1997" title="Irish general election, 1997">1997 general election</a> a Fianna Fáil-<a href="/wiki/Progressive_Democrats" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a> came to power and Ahern was appointed <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Social_Protection" title="Minister for Social Protection">Minister for Community, Social and Family Affairs</a>. As Social Affairs Minister Ahern also introduced the largest social welfare and pension increases in Irish history. He also achieved pension rights for Irish people who had emigrated from Ireland prior to 1953.
Following the return of the government at the <a href="/wiki/Irish_general_election, _2002" title="Irish general election, 2002">2002 general election</a> Ahern was appointed <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Communications, _Energy_and_Natural_Resources" title="Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources">Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</a>. In this post he was critical of the main telecommunications provider <a href="/wiki/Eircom" title="Eircom">Eircom</a>. His Department introduced a system of Policy Directions to the telecoms regulator mandating, amongst other things, Flat Rate Internet Access. It also devised the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>'s Broadband Action Plan which entailed the government building an alternative fibre infractructure and co-location facilities. He sanctioned a reform package for public service broadcasting in Ireland and introduced a Charter for Ireland's national broadcaster <a href="/wiki/Raidi%C3%B3_Teilif%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann" title="Raidió Teilifís Éireann">RTÉ</a>. His Department introduced a programme to provide free broadband internet access to schools. He secured EU recognition and protection of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Conservation_Box" title="Irish Conservation Box">Irish Box</a>, an area of Irish <a href="/wiki/Territorial_waters" title="Territorial waters">territorial waters</a> out of bounds to Spanish and Portuguese fishermen.
Following a <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_reshuffle" title="Cabinet reshuffle" class="mw-redirect">cabinet reshuffle</a> in 2004 Ahern became <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" title="Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade">Minister for Foreign Affairs</a>, the first Louth TD to hold that position since <a href="/wiki/Frank_Aiken" title="Frank Aiken">Frank Aiken</a> in the 1960s. Shortly into his tenure in April 2005 Ahern was appointed one of four special envoys for <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> reform by the UN Secretary General, <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a>.
Ahern spoke of the 'Third Phase' in Irish foreign policy which he calls "Active Neutrality". This is a vision of non-aligned Ireland taking up its international responsibilities by acting as a bridge between the developed and developing world, and by acting as a world leader in conflict and disasters. In this regard he took an extremely outspoken line on the crisis in <a href="/wiki/Darfur" title="Darfur">Darfur</a>, calling on the international community to 'wake up to the reality of rape, murder and destruction in the region. More recently Ahern has announced the establishment of an <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Irish</a> Volunteer Corps and a Rapid Response Corps which would harness existing expertise amongst the Irish public to assist in the developing world. He has stated that, in foreign policy terms, 'the single greatest, economic, environmental, geopolitical issue now facing us is climate change.'.
As Foreign Minister, Ahern was heavily involved in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process" title="Northern Ireland peace process">Northern Ireland peace process</a>. Like many others in his party he describes himself as a republican and stated at the 2006 <a href="/wiki/Se%C3%A1n_Moylan" title="Seán Moylan">Seán Moylan</a> commemoration in <a href="/wiki/Cork_(city)" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a> that "as an Irish Republican my main personal and political goal is to live to see the <a href="/wiki/United_Ireland" title="United Ireland">unity of Ireland</a>.".
As Foreign Minister he led a campaign to secure a path to permanent residency for the 25, 000 to 50, 000 undocumented Irish citizens resident in the United States. He also introduced free passports for Irish senior citizens and had called for a comprehensive ban on the use of cluster munitions. Ahern was the first government Minister to call for a constitutional referendum on the issues arising from the supreme court decision on statutory rape, five months before it became government policy.
Ahern was appointed <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" title="Minister for Justice and Equality">Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</a> on the 7 May 2008 by the new <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="/wiki/Brian_Cowen" title="Brian Cowen">Brian Cowen</a>. On 29 April 2009, Ahern proposed a controversial amendment to the Defamation Bill adding the crime of <a href="/wiki/Blasphemy" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a> to the statute books.
The amendment was passed in the Dáil on the 9 July 2009 with only an hour of the debate set aside for the bill, and was then narrowly passed by the <a href="/wiki/Seanad_%C3%89ireann" title="Seanad Éireann">Seanad</a> the next day by walk-through vote, after being defeated in the initial electronic vote. This amendment has been criticized by many within the public sphere, free speech campaigners and some ministers of European Union member states. As of 2010, <a href="/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Ireland" title="Blasphemy law in Ireland" class="mw-redirect">the law</a> is in effect.
Ahern is responsible for the Civil Partnership Bill 2009 published on 26 June 2009.
He received the <a href="/wiki/Murphy_Report" title="Murphy Report">Murphy Report</a> into <a href="/wiki/Sexual_abuse_scandal_in_the_Catholic_archdiocese_of_Dublin" title="Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin">child sexual abuse</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Dublin" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin">Dublin Diocese</a> in June 2009. Most of the report was published on 26 November 2009 of that year, though parts were not, due to names that were undergoing prosecution.
As part of a <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_30th_Dail" title="Government of the 30th Dail" class="mw-redirect">reshuffle in March 2010</a>, the Equality affairs section of the department was moved to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" title="Department of Children and Youth Affairs">Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</a>.
Ahern said that in March 2010 he will propose to the Cabinet a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment" title="Constitutional amendment">constitutional amendment</a> deleting the constitutional prohibition on <a href="/wiki/Blasphemy" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a> when the children's rights amendment comes up. The children's rights amendment is set to be put to referendum in the Autumn 2010. Ahern was opposed to a stand-alone referendum that would have cost €3 or €4 million, his spokesman added. At the time, Ahern wrote in <a href="/wiki/The_Irish_Times" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a>: “My intention is to remove the possibility of prison sentences and private prosecutions for blasphemy, currently provided for in Irish law. The only credible alternative to this move is a blasphemy referendum, which I consider, in the current circumstances, a costly and unwarranted diversion.”.
On 15 November 2010, he described as 'fiction' the speculation that Ireland was about to seek financial aid from the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. He told RTÉ's The Week in Politics that 'nothing is going on at the direction of Government in relation to this.' On 21 November 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="/wiki/Brian_Cowen" title="Brian Cowen">Brian Cowen</a> confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's <a href="/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility" title="European Financial Stability Facility">European Financial Stability Facility</a> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>.
On 30 November 2010, he announced he will not contest his Dáil seat at the <a href="/wiki/Irish_general_election, _2011" title="Irish general election, 2011">2011 general election</a>, as he has <a href="/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and said it was a "painful medical condition necessitating heavy medication". He retires to a combined annual ministerial and TD's pension of €128, 300. He resigned as Minister for Justice and Law Reform on 19 January 2011.
During the debate on decriminalisation of Homosexuality in the Dáil in 1993, he agreed with a statement by Fine Gael TD, <a href="/wiki/Brendan_McGahon" title="Brendan McGahon">Brendan McGahon</a> which reads: "Homosexuality is a departure from normality and while homosexuals deserve our compassion they do not deserve our tolerance" and who described homosexuals as being "like lefthand drivers driving on the right-hand side of the road.".
Ahern himself added: "Will we eventually see the day in this country when, as has happened in the USA, homosexuals will seek the right to adopt children? We should think seriously about this possibility". Following his appointment as Minister responsible for equality, Ahern has refused to be drawn on this matter and has not given an answer as to whether he still holds those opinions.
Ahern was responsible for introducing legislation recognising <a href="/wiki/Civil_partnership" title="Civil partnership" class="mw-redirect">civil partnerships</a> for <a href="/wiki/Same-sex" title="Same-sex" class="mw-redirect">same-sex</a> couples. He declared the legislation (<a href="/wiki/Civil_Partnership_and_Certain_Rights_and_Obligations_of_Cohabitants_Act_2010" title="Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010">Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a>), which passed into law in July 2010 as "one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to be enacted since independence." .
Dermot Ahern denied claims that he had made representations to former Minister for Justice <a href="/wiki/Michael_McDowell" title="Michael McDowell">Michael McDowell</a> on behalf of <a href="/wiki/Michael_McKevitt" title="Michael McKevitt">Michael McKevitt</a>, who has been convicted of directing terrorism. He said that had merely forwarded an email from McKevitts' wife, <a href="/wiki/Bernadette_Sands_McKevitt" title="Bernadette Sands McKevitt">Bernadette Sands McKevitt</a>, who was a constituent in 2004.
