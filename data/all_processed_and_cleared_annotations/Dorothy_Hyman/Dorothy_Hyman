Dorothy Hyman (born 9 May 1941 in Cudworth, Barnsley, Yorkshire) is a British athlete who competed mainly in the 100 metres.
She competed for Great Britain in the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome, Italy in the 100 metres, where she won the Silver medal. She followed this up by winning the bronze medal in the 200 metres.
Four years later in Tokyo, Japan in the 1964 Games she helped the Great Britain team pick up a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 m relay with team mates Janet Simpson, Mary Rand and Daphne Arden.
She also won individual 100 m Gold and 200 m Silver at the 1962 European Championships in Belgrade and, representing England, completed the 100 m/200 m sprint double at the 1962 Commonwealth Games.
Arguably Britain's best ever female sprinter, she has a stadium in her home village in Cudworth, Barnsley, named in her honour.
In 2011, she was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.
