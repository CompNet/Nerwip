Dwight Ball MHA is the Leader of the Official Opposition and interim leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador. He represents the electoral district of Humber Valley in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. On January 3, 2012, Ball began his duties as Leader of the Official Opposition and interim leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Ball was the Liberal candidate in the district of Humber Valley in the 2003, provincial election but was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Kathy Goudie by less than 200 votes. When Goudie resigned from the legislature, Ball ran in a by-election to succeed her on February 13, 2007. At first, it was announced that Progressive Conservative candidate Darryl Kelly had won the by-election by a margin of twelve votes; however, Ball was later declared elected by a margin of 18 votes. A judicial recount was conducted weeks later and resulted in a reduction of Ball's lead to seven votes. In a rematch in the general election on October 9, 2007, Kelly defeated Ball by 254 votes. Four years later Ball once again ran as the Liberal candidate in the October 2011, election and this time narrowly defeated Kelly by 68 votes.
At a press conference on December 15, 2011, the Liberal Party announced that Ball would serve as interim leader of the party and as the Leader of the Official Opposition, effective January 3, 2012. He succeeds Kevin Aylward, who failed to win a seat in the general election, as leader of the Liberal Party and Yvonne Jones as the Official Opposition Leader. Ball announced on the same day that he planned to run for the permanent leadership of the party at the next leadership convention, and that he would step down as interim leader 90 days before the convention to even the playing field for other candidates. A leadership convention is not expected to be called till sometime in 2013.
