His works were popularized by <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>French<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> mathematician <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Benoit Mandelbrot<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>; the <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Julia<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Mandelbrot<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> fractals are closely related.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Julia<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was born in the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Algerian<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> town of <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Sidi Bel Abbes<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, at the time governed by the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>French<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>. During his youth, he had an interest in mathematics and music. His studies were interrupted at the age of 21 years old, when <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>France<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> became involved with <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>World War I<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> and he was conscripted to serve with the army.

His many operations to remedy the situation were all unsuccessful, and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Julia<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> gained attention for his mathematical work after the war when a 199-page article he wrote was featured in the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>, a <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>French<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> mathematics journal. The article, which he published during <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1918<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> at the age of 25, titled "<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Mémoire sur l'itération des fonctions rationnelles<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>" described the iteration of a rational function. The article gained immense popularity among mathematicians and the general population as a whole, and so resulted in <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Julia<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s later receiving of the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Grand Prix de l'Académie des Sciences<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>. Despite his fame, his works were mostly forgotten until the day <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Benoit Mandelbrot<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> mentioned them in his works.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Julia<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> died in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Paris<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> at the age of 85.
