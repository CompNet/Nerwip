Georges Jean Marie Valiron (7 September 1884 – March 1955) was a French mathematician, notable for his contributions to analysis, in particular, the asymptotic behaviour of and Tauberian theorems.
Valiron obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Paris in 1914, under supervision of Émile Borel. Since 1922 he held a professorship at the University of Strasbourg, and since 1931 a chair at the University of Paris. He held a plenary speech at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich.
He was awarded the title Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1954. One of Valiron's doctoral students, Laurent Schwartz, went on to receive a Fields Medal in 1950.
