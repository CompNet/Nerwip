His research was mainly in the fields of <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_logic" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a>, (<a href="/wiki/Multivalued_function" title="Multivalued function">Łukasiewicz-Moisil algebra</a>), <a href="/wiki/Algebraic_logic" title="Algebraic logic">Algebraic logic</a>, <a href="/wiki/MV-algebra" title="MV-algebra">MV-algebra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algebra" title="Algebra">algebra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Differential_equations" title="Differential equations" class="mw-redirect">differential equations</a>. He is viewed as the father of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> in Romania.
Moisil was also a member of the Academy of Sciences in <a href="/wiki/Bologna" title="Bologna">Bologna</a> and of the International Institute of Philosophy. In 1996, the <a href="/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society" title="IEEE Computer Society">IEEE Computer Society</a> awarded him posthumously the Computer Pioneer Award.
Grigore Moisil was born in 1906 in Tulcea into an <a href="/wiki/Intellectual" title="Intellectual">intellectual</a> family. His grandfather, Grigore Moisil (1814–1891), a <a href="/wiki/Clergyman" title="Clergyman" class="mw-redirect">clergyman</a>, was one of the founders of the first Romanian high school in <a href="/wiki/N%C4%83s%C4%83ud" title="Năsăud">Năsăud</a>. His father, Constantin Moisil (1867–1958), was a history professor, <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeologist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Numismatics" title="Numismatics">numismatist</a>; as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Romanian_Academy" title="Romanian Academy">Romanian Academy</a>, he filled the position of Director of the Numismatics Office of the Academy. His mother, Elena (1863–1949), was a teacher in Tulcea, later the director of "Maidanul Dulapului" school in <a href="/wiki/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> (now "Enăchiţă Văcărescu" school).
Grigore Moisil attended <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" title="Primary school">primary school</a> in Bucharest, then high school in <a href="/wiki/Vaslui" title="Vaslui">Vaslui</a> and Bucharest (at "<a href="/wiki/Spiru_Haret" title="Spiru Haret">Spiru Haret</a>" High School) between 1916-1922. In 1924 he was admitted at the Constructions Faculty of the <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic_University_of_Bucharest" title="Polytechnic University of Bucharest" class="mw-redirect">Polytechnic University of Bucharest</a>, and also the Mathematics Faculty of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bucharest" title="University of Bucharest">University of Bucharest</a>. He showed a stronger interest in mathematics, so he quit the Polytechnic University in 1929, despite already having passed all the third-year exams. In 1929 he defended his <a href="/wiki/Ph.D." title="Ph.D." class="mw-redirect">Ph.D.</a> thesis, La mécanique analytique des systemes continus (Analytical mechanics of continuous systems), before a commission led by <a href="/wiki/Gheorghe_%C5%A2i%C5%A3eica" title="Gheorghe Ţiţeica">Gheorghe Ţiţeica</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Dimitrie_Pompeiu" title="Dimitrie Pompeiu">Dimitrie Pompeiu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anton_Davidoglu" title="Anton Davidoglu">Anton Davidoglu</a> as members. The thesis was published the same year by the Gauthier-Villars publishing house in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and received favourable comments from <a href="/wiki/Vito_Volterra" title="Vito Volterra">Vito Volterra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita" title="Tullio Levi-Civita">Tullio Levi-Civita</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Pierre_L%C3%A9vy" title="Paul Pierre Lévy">Paul Lévy</a>.
In 1930 Moisil went to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" title="University of Paris">University of Paris</a> for further study in mathematics, which he finalized the next year with the paper On a class of systems of equations with partial derivatives from mathematical physics. In 1931 he returned to Romania, where he was appointed in a teaching position at the Mathematics Faculty of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Ia%C5%9Fi" title="University of Iaşi" class="mw-redirect">University of Iaşi</a>. Shortly after, he left for a one-year <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation" title="Rockefeller Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> scholarship to study in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. In 1932 he returned to Iaşi, where he remained for almost 10 years, developing a close relationship with professor Alexandru Myller. He taught the first <a href="/wiki/Modern_algebra" title="Modern algebra" class="mw-redirect">modern algebra</a> course in Romania, named Logic and theory of proof, at the University of Iaşi. During that time, he started writing a series of papers based on the works of <a href="/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz" title="Jan Łukasiewicz">Jan Łukasiewicz</a> in <a href="/wiki/Multi-valued_logic" title="Multi-valued logic" class="mw-redirect">multi-valued logic</a>. His research in mathematical logic laid the foundation for significant work done afterwards in Romania, as well as <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. While in Iaşi, he completed research remarkable for the many new ideas and for his way of finding and using new connections between concepts from different areas of mathematics. He was promoted to Full Professor in November 1939.
In 1941, a position of professor at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bucharest" title="University of Bucharest">University of Bucharest</a> opened up, and Moisil applied for it. However, <a href="/wiki/Gheorghe_Vr%C3%A2nceanu" title="Gheorghe Vrânceanu">Gheorghe Vrânceanu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ion_Barbu" title="Ion Barbu">Dan Barbilian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Miron_Nicolescu" title="Miron Nicolescu">Miron Nicolescu</a> also applied for the position, and Vrânceanu got it. Moisil approached the Ministry of Education, arguing that it would be a great opportunity for mathematics in Romania if all four could be appointed. As a result of his appeal, all four mathematicians were hired. Moisil moved to <a href="/wiki/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, where he became a Professor in the Faculty of Mathematics (later the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science) at the University of Bucharest, on December 30, 1941.
From 1946 to 1948, Moisil took a leave of absence, being named <a href="/wiki/Plenipotentiary" title="Plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a> envoy to <a href="/wiki/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a>. While in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, he gave several series of mathematics lectures at <a href="/wiki/Istanbul_University" title="Istanbul University">Istanbul University</a> and <a href="/wiki/Istanbul_Technical_University" title="Istanbul Technical University">Istanbul Technical University</a>.
In 1948, he resumed teaching at the University of Bucharest. That same year, he was elected to the Romanian Academy, and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Mathematics_of_the_Romanian_Academy" title="Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy">Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy</a>. After 1965, one of his outstanding students-- George Georgescu -- worked closely with him on multi-valued logics, and after the emergence of Romania from dictatorship in 1989, he became a Professor of Mathematics and Logic at the same university and department as Moisil in 1991. His student also published extensive, original work on <a href="/wiki/Algebraic_logic" title="Algebraic logic">algebraic logic</a>, <a href="/wiki/MV-algebra" title="MV-algebra">MV-algebra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algebra" title="Algebra">Algebra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algebraic_topology" title="Algebraic topology">Algebraic topology</a>, categories of <a href="/wiki/MV-algebra" title="MV-algebra">MV-algebras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Category_theory" title="Category theory">category theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Multi-valued" title="Multi-valued" class="mw-redirect">Łukasiewicz-Moisil algebra</a>.
Moisil published papers on <a href="/wiki/Mechanics" title="Mechanics">mechanics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_analysis" title="Mathematical analysis">mathematical analysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algebra" title="Algebra">algebra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_logic" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a>. He developed a multi-dimensional extension of Pompeiu's areolar derivative, and studied monogenic functions of one <a href="/wiki/Hypercomplex_number" title="Hypercomplex number">hypercomplex</a> variable with applications to mechanics. Moisil also introduced some <a href="/wiki/MV-algebra" title="MV-algebra">many-valued algebras</a>, which he called Łukasiewicz algebras (now also named <a href="/wiki/Multi-valued_logic" title="Multi-valued logic" class="mw-redirect">Łukasiewicz-Moisil algebras</a>), and used them in logic and the study of <a href="/wiki/Automata_theory" title="Automata theory">automata theory</a>. He created new methods to analyze <a href="/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton" title="Deterministic finite automaton">finite automata</a>, and had many contributions to the field of automata theory in algebra.
Moisil had important contributions in the creation of the first Romanian <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. He played a fundamental role in the development of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> in Romania, and in raising the first generations of Romanian computer scientists. In 1996, he was awarded posthumously the Computer Pioneer Award by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> Computer Society.
