Guy Verhofstadt (Dutch pronunciation:&#160; &#160; ; born Guy Maurice Marie Louise Verhofstadt, 11 April 1953) is a <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> politician who was the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Belgium" title="List of Prime Ministers of Belgium" class="mw-redirect">47th Prime Minister of Belgium</a> from 1999 to 2008. He is currently a <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a> and leader of the <a href="/wiki/Group_of_the_Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe" title="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe">Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe</a>.
Born in 1953 in <a href="/wiki/Dendermonde" title="Dendermonde">Dendermonde</a>, he became president of the Flemish Liberal Student's Union (1972-1974) while studying <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Ghent_University" title="Ghent University">University of Ghent</a>. He quickly became the secretary of <a href="/wiki/Willy_De_Clercq" title="Willy De Clercq">Willy De Clercq</a>, who was at that time the president of the Flemish liberal party (<a href="/wiki/Party_for_Freedom_and_Progress" title="Party for Freedom and Progress">Party for Freedom and Progress</a>, PVV). In 1982, at age 29, he became president of the party. In 1985 he was elected into the Chamber of Deputies, and became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget under Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Wilfried_Martens" title="Wilfried Martens">Wilfried Martens</a>. Because of his economic views and his young age, he became known as "Baby <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Thatcher</a>". Another nickname from that era is "da joenk", a <a href="/wiki/Brabantian" title="Brabantian">Brabantian</a> dialect expression meaning "that kid" (in a pejorative sense, referring to his rather iconoclastic and immature style).
After being ousted from government he became leader of the opposition. After a failed attempt to form a government in November 1991, he changed the PVV into the <a href="/wiki/Flemish_Liberals_and_Democrats" title="Flemish Liberals and Democrats" class="mw-redirect">Flemish Liberals and Democrats</a> (VLD). This new party attracted many politicians from other parties, notably from the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Union_(Belgium)" title="People's Union (Belgium)">Volksunie</a> (VU) and the <a href="/wiki/Christen-Democratisch_en_Vlaams" title="Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams">Christian People's Party</a> (CVP).
However, despite the fact that many had high expectations, the party did not manage to outstrip the CVP. Verhofstadt resigned and disappeared from the political scene, only to return to the party's presidency in 1997 with a less radical image. He gradually moved away from <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism" title="Neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a> (partly under the influence of his brother <a href="/wiki/Dirk_Verhofstadt" title="Dirk Verhofstadt">Dirk</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" title="Social liberalism">social liberal</a> <a href="/wiki/Political_philosophy" title="Political philosophy">political philosopher</a>), and became more of a <a href="/wiki/Centrism" title="Centrism">centrist</a> figure, a change which especially became clear during his first term as Prime Minister.
Partly because of a <a href="/wiki/Dioxine_affair" title="Dioxine affair" class="mw-redirect">food scandal</a> that broke out just before the 1999 elections, the VLD became the largest party in the country, obtaining over 22% of the vote in Flanders. He quickly formed a coalition with the socialist and the green party in <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, and with the French speaking counterparts of these parties (a symmetric coalition) in Brussels and Wallonia. He was appointed Prime Minister on 12 July 1999, the first liberal to hold that office since 1938. It was the first Belgian government without a Christian Democratic party since 1958, and the first one which included the green parties.
Verhofstadt was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Vision_for_Europe_Award" title="Vision for Europe Award">Vision for Europe Award</a> in 2002 for his work toward a more unified Europe. The economic situation gave him leeway in raising the lowest social alimonies and lowering taxation. After 2001, the economic situation worsened. The 'Aging Fund' or 'Silver Fund' was set up, in order to ensure the maintenance of pensions until 2030. But despite his efforts to boost the economy while attempting to maintain the social benefits system, unemployment rose, after previously falling during the second <a href="/wiki/Jean-Luc_Dehaene" title="Jean-Luc Dehaene">Dehaene</a> cabinet.
Much to the disapproval of his coalition partners, Verhofstadt and his VLD opposed granting the right to vote to non-EU residents. Instead, they proposed and were able to liberalize procedure for obtaining Belgian citizenship.
During the prelude to the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_disarmament_crisis" title="Iraq disarmament crisis">Iraq crisis of 2003</a>, Belgium joined France, Germany and Russia in their opposition to the invasion.
Following the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_general_election, _2003" title="Belgian general election, 2003">2003 general elections</a>, Verhofstadt formed his second cabinet without the green parties, who were virtually annihilated in the election. For various reasons, the formation of the second government was delayed well beyond normal: the economic situation worsened to 1999 levels, both politically similar parties (liberals and socialists) gained approximately the same seats. Additionally, the various world governments were pressing for the abolition of the (also known as the "<a href="/wiki/Genocide_law" title="Genocide law" class="mw-redirect">genocide law</a>"), which gave Belgian judges the authority to accuse and sentence non-Belgians with <a href="/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a>. Accusations that were made had rarely been followed up, and were often dismissed as being little more than politically motivated international insults. Verhofstadt's second government was sworn in on 12 July 2003, with both coalition partners having agreed to abolish the so-called "genocide law" and replace it with a much weaker one.
Guy Verhofstadt second Government consisted of his liberal <a href="/wiki/Open_Flemish_Liberals_and_Democrats" title="Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats" class="mw-redirect">Open VLD</a> their sister liberal <a href="/wiki/Reformist_Movement" title="Reformist Movement" class="mw-redirect">MR</a>, the Flemish social democratic <a href="/wiki/Socialistische_Partij_Anders" title="Socialistische Partij Anders">SP.a</a> and their sister social democratic party <a href="/wiki/Parti_Socialiste" title="Parti Socialiste">PS</a> to form another <a href="/wiki/Purple_(government)" title="Purple (government)">Purple coalition</a>.
In the <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flemish</a> regional elections of 13 June 2004, his party lost votes, slipping into third place in <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>. Though this has had no direct impact upon his position as Prime Minister, there were rumours that the <a href="/wiki/Christen-Democratisch_en_Vlaams" title="Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams">Christian Democratic and Flemish</a> (CD&amp; V) party that won the elections, would participate in federal government. Verhofstadt was suggested as a candidate to replace <a href="/wiki/Romano_Prodi" title="Romano Prodi">Romano Prodi</a> as the next President of the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, but his candidacy was opposed and rejected by a coalition led by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>.
Since then, Verhofstadt has been faced with internal crisis after crisis. The first crisis coming to a head in the autumn of 2004 was the question whether <a href="/wiki/DHL" title="DHL" class="mw-redirect">DHL</a> would invest in <a href="/wiki/Brussels_Airport" title="Brussels Airport">Brussels Airport</a>, located in the Flemish municipality of <a href="/wiki/Zaventem" title="Zaventem">Zaventem</a>. The question which nearly caused the collapse of the cabinet was whether to grant DHL extra landing rights during the night, this being a hot topic of public debate and various court cases. In the end the split between employment and night rest was for nought as DHL had only used the Zaventem option in order to get better conditions from <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>.
After the DHL crisis, Verhofstadt was faced with a communautary crisis with regard to dividing the administrative arrondissement <a href="/wiki/Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde" title="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</a> commonly abbreviated to BHV. The dividing was an issue that the parties forming the Flemish regional government had written in their government agreement. This caused a veto to be posed by the Walloon parties. The crisis dragged on until spring 2005 when the matter was shelved until after the federal elections of 2007 as the Flemish parties forming the government, given the for them disastrous opinion polls, didn't have the nerve to collapse the government. <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Belgium" title="Constitutional Court of Belgium">The constitutional court of Belgium</a> ruled that all elections held after 10 June 2007 are invalid with the constitution because of the non-separation of <a href="/wiki/Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde" title="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</a>.
In the autumn of 2005, Verhofstadt managed to score a success when he was able to negotiate a "Generation Pact" with regard to employment and social reforms, regardless of the opposition and actions of the unions.
Verhofstadt was sworn in as municipal councilor in Ghent in January 2007, as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_municipal_elections, _2006" title="Belgian municipal elections, 2006" class="mw-redirect">2006 municipal elections</a>. In the council, he is seated next to another cabinet minister, <a href="/wiki/Freya_Van_den_Bossche" title="Freya Van den Bossche">Freya Van den Bossche</a>, who was elected a municipal councillor as well. He even postponed a visit to the <a href="/wiki/Russian_President" title="Russian President" class="mw-redirect">Russian President</a> <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to be able to go to the first session of the newly elected council.
Verhofstadt led the VLD into the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_general_election, _2007" title="Belgian general election, 2007">2007 general election</a>. Already with the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_municipal_elections, _2006" title="Belgian municipal elections, 2006" class="mw-redirect">2006 municipal elections</a>, the VLD showed signs of fatigue with the Flemish voter, who seem to have had enough of eight years of Verhofstadt, and the purple coalition governments. In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat and asked for a new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after a new government has been formed. However, the <a href="/wiki/2007_Belgian_government_formation" title="2007 Belgian government formation" class="mw-redirect">formation of a new government</a> was complicated, and in the end, CD&amp; V politician <a href="/wiki/Yves_Leterme" title="Yves Leterme">Yves Leterme</a> failed to bring about a new government. Yet certain policy matters became politically urgent. The King therefore asked Verhofstadt to mediate an "interim government" that would be in office for three months and could propose a 2008 budget. A deal was struck in December, and the "interim government" was set for inauguration on 21 December 2007. On 23 December 2007 this interim government won a vote of confidence in parliament, with 97 votes in favor, 46 opposed, and one abstention, assuring it legitimacy for three months.
A "permanent government" under leadership of <a href="/wiki/Yves_Leterme" title="Yves Leterme">Yves Leterme</a> assumed office 20 March 2008.
One of the first decisions of the new government, on 21 December 2007, was to raise the security level after it foiled an attempted jail break of an Al Qaeda operative.
After his premiership he took up the seat of Senator to which he had been elected in 2007. In the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election, _2009_(Belgium)" title="European Parliament election, 2009 (Belgium)">2009 European Parliament election</a>, Verhofstadt was elected a member of the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> for the term 2009-2014. He also has been put forward as the possible candidate for replacing <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Barroso" title="José Manuel Barroso">José Manuel Barroso</a> as the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" title="President of the European Commission">president of the European Commission</a> by a coalition of <a href="/wiki/European_Greens%E2%80%93European_Free_Alliance" title="European Greens–European Free Alliance" class="mw-redirect">greens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists" title="Party of European Socialists">socialists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe" title="Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe">liberals</a>.
On July 1, 2009 he was elected President of the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe" title="Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe</a> group in the European Parliament. On July 14, 2009 he took up his seat in the newly sworn-in <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> to which he had been elected in June 2009.
On 15 September, 2010 Verhofstadt supported the new initiative <a href="/wiki/Spinelli_Group" title="Spinelli Group">Spinelli Group</a>, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU).
