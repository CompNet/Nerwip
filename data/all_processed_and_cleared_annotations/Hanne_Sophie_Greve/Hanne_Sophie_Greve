Hanne Sophie Greve (born 14 April 1952 in Tønsberg, Norway) is a Norwegian judge.
She graduated as cand.jur. in (1976) and later (1988) dr. juris at the University of Bergen. She is a former judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Before she was appointed to the position in the Hague she was a judge at Gulating Court of Appeal and was involved in a number of national and international projects where human rights were in focus.
Her doctoral thesis was about refugees from Cambodia, a subject about which she has shown a particular interest and written about on various occasions.
Greve is currently (as of 2007) writing a book on an alleged red herring manoeuver originating with Winston Churchill, concerning an allied invasion in 1942 during World War II. Greve is of the opinion that this invasion never was anything other than a distraction, a distraction that cost the lives of several hundred Norwegians, among which the inhabitants of a fiskevær in the Vestlandet region of the country. No date has yet been given for the publication of the book.
On April 30, 2007 Greve stated that Norway has come to be perceived as a haven for international war criminals just like the South American countries after World War II. This statement was given in a TV documentary on Norway's TV 2.
In 1995 she was awarded the Fritt Ord Award.
