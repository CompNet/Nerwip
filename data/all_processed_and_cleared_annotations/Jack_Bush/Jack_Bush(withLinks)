His paintings are associated with the <a href="/wiki/Color_Field" title="Color Field">Color Field</a> movement and <a href="/wiki/Post-painterly_Abstraction" title="Post-painterly Abstraction">Post-painterly Abstraction</a>.
In his early stages, Bush was influenced by the work of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Comfort" title="Charles Comfort">Charles Comfort</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Group_of_Seven_(artists)" title="Group of Seven (artists)">Group of Seven</a>. During the 1930s, he ran a <a href="/wiki/Commercial_art" title="Commercial art">commercial art</a> business and, by night, furthered his studies at the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_College_of_Art" title="Ontario College of Art" class="mw-redirect">Ontario College of Art</a>. Bush, like other Canadian artists of the time, was sheltered from major European influences. After seeing the work of the American <a href="/wiki/Abstract_Expressionists" title="Abstract Expressionists" class="mw-redirect">Abstract Expressionists</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Bush's canvases changed dramatically.
Bush developed his work and approach to abstraction through the 1950s. He was a member of <a href="/wiki/Painters_Eleven" title="Painters Eleven">Painters Eleven</a>, the group founded by <a href="/wiki/William_Ronald" title="William Ronald">William Ronald</a> in 1953 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic <a href="/wiki/Clement_Greenberg" title="Clement Greenberg">Clement Greenberg</a>. Critical at first, Greenberg became a mentor to Bush and encouraged him to refine his palette, technique, and approach. As a result of Greenberg's guidance, Bush became closely tied to <a href="/wiki/Color_Field" title="Color Field">Color Field</a> Painting. Bush became friends with artists associated with color-field like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and also Anthong Caro. As Painters Eleven disbanded in 1960, Bush moved on, and in the end became one of the more successful artists to come from this group.
Jack Bush represented Canada at the 1967 <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Art_Biennial" title="São Paulo Art Biennial">São Paulo Art Biennial</a>, and in 1976 the <a href="/wiki/Art_Gallery_of_Ontario" title="Art Gallery of Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> toured a large retrospective of his work. He died in 1977.
