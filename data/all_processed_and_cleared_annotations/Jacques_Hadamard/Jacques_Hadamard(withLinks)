Jacques Salomon Hadamard <a href="/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="Fellow of the Royal Society" class="mw-redirect">FRS</a> (8 December 1865 – 17 October 1963) was a <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> who made major contributions in <a href="/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Complex_function_theory" title="Complex function theory" class="mw-redirect">complex function theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Differential_geometry" title="Differential geometry">differential geometry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Partial_differential_equations" title="Partial differential equations" class="mw-redirect">partial differential equations</a>.
.
The son of a teacher, Amédée Hadamard, of <a href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> descent, and Claire Marie Jeanne Picard, Hadamard attended the <a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Charlemagne" title="Lycée Charlemagne">Lycée Charlemagne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand" title="Lycée Louis-le-Grand">Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a>, where his father taught. In 1884 Hadamard entered the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure" title="École Normale Supérieure">École Normale Supérieure</a>, having been placed first in the entrance examinations both there and at the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique" title="École Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>. His teachers included <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tannery" title="Paul Tannery">Tannery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermite" title="Hermite" class="mw-redirect">Hermite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Darboux" title="Darboux" class="mw-redirect">Darboux</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_%C3%89mile_Appell" title="Paul Émile Appell">Appell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Goursat" title="Goursat" class="mw-redirect">Goursat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles_%C3%89mile_Picard" title="Charles Émile Picard">Picard</a>. He obtained his doctorate in 1892 and in the same year was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques for his essay on the <a href="/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function" title="Riemann zeta function">Riemann zeta function</a>.
In 1892 Hadamard married Louise-Anna Trénel, also of Jewish descent, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. The following year he took up a lectureship in the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bordeaux" title="University of Bordeaux">University of Bordeaux</a>, where he proved his <a href="/wiki/Hadamard%27s_inequality" title="Hadamard's inequality">celebrated inequality</a> on <a href="/wiki/Determinant" title="Determinant">determinants</a>, which led to the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Hadamard_matrix" title="Hadamard matrix">Hadamard matrices</a> when equality holds. In 1896 he made two important contributions: he proved the <a href="/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" title="Prime number theorem">prime number theorem</a>, using <a href="/wiki/Complex_function_theory" title="Complex function theory" class="mw-redirect">complex function theory</a> (also proved independently by <a href="/wiki/De_la_Vall%C3%A9e_Poussin" title="De la Vallée Poussin" class="mw-redirect">de la Vallée Poussin</a>); and he was awarded the Bordin Prize of the <a href="/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="French Academy of Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a> for his work on <a href="/wiki/Geodesics" title="Geodesics" class="mw-redirect">geodesics</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces" title="Differential geometry of surfaces">differential geometry of surfaces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dynamical_systems" title="Dynamical systems" class="mw-redirect">dynamical systems</a>. In the same year he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Rational Mechanics in Bordeaux. His foundational work on geometry and <a href="/wiki/Symbolic_dynamics" title="Symbolic dynamics">symbolic dynamics</a> continued in 1898 with the study of geodesics on surfaces of <a href="/wiki/Negative_curvature" title="Negative curvature" class="mw-redirect">negative curvature</a>. For his cumulative work, he was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Prix_Poncelet" title="Prix Poncelet" class="mw-redirect">Prix Poncelet</a> in 1898.
After the <a href="/wiki/Dreyfus_affair" title="Dreyfus affair">Dreyfus affair</a>, which involved him personally because his wife was related to Dreyfus, Hadamard became politically active and a staunch supporter of <a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> causes though he professed to be an atheist in his religion.
In 1897 he moved back to Paris, holding positions in the <a href="/wiki/Sorbonne" title="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France" title="Collège de France">Collège de France</a>, where he was appointed Professor of Mechanics in 1909. In addition to this post, he was appointed to chairs of analysis at the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique" title="École Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> in 1912 and at the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale" title="École Centrale" class="mw-redirect">École Centrale</a> in 1920, succeeding <a href="/wiki/Camille_Jordan" title="Camille Jordan">Jordan</a> and Appell. In Paris Hadamard concentrated his interests on the problems of mathematical physics, in particular <a href="/wiki/Partial_differential_equations" title="Partial differential equations" class="mw-redirect">partial differential equations</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Calculus_of_variations" title="Calculus of variations">calculus of variations</a> and the foundations of <a href="/wiki/Functional_analysis" title="Functional analysis">functional analysis</a>. He introduced the idea of <a href="/wiki/Well-posed_problem" title="Well-posed problem">well-posed problem</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Method_of_descent" title="Method of descent" class="mw-redirect">method of descent</a> in the theory of <a href="/wiki/Partial_differential_equation" title="Partial differential equation">partial differential equations</a>, culminating in his seminal book on the subject, based on lectures given at <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> in 1922. He was elected to the <a href="/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="French Academy of Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a> in 1916, in succession to <a href="/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Henri Poincaré">Poincaré</a>, whose complete works he helped edit. Later in his life he wrote on <a href="/wiki/Probability_theory" title="Probability theory">probability theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_education" title="Mathematical education" class="mw-redirect">mathematical education</a>. He was awarded the <a href="/wiki/CNRS_Gold_medal" title="CNRS Gold medal">CNRS Gold medal</a> for his lifetime achievements in 1956.
Hadamard's students included <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Ren%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A9chet" title="Maurice René Fréchet">Maurice Fréchet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Pierre_L%C3%A9vy" title="Paul Pierre Lévy">Paul Lévy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Szolem_Mandelbrojt" title="Szolem Mandelbrojt">Szolem Mandelbrojt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil" title="André Weil">André Weil</a>.
In his book Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, Hadamard uses <a href="/wiki/Introspection" title="Introspection">introspection</a> to describe mathematical thought processes. In sharp contrast to authors who identify <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cognition" title="Cognition">cognition</a>, he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Mental_images" title="Mental images" class="mw-redirect">mental images</a> that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking them how they did their work.
Hadamard described the experiences of the mathematicians/theoretical physicists <a href="/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="Carl Friedrich Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="Hermann von Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a> and others as viewing entire solutions with “sudden spontaneousness.”.
Hadamard described the process as having four steps of the five-step <a href="/wiki/Graham_Wallas" title="Graham Wallas">Graham Wallas</a> <a href="/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creative</a> process model, with the first three also having been put forth by Helmholtz: Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification.
