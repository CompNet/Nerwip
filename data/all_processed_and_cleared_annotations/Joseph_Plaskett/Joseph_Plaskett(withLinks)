Plaskett studied art in Banff, San Francisco, New York, London and Paris. He has lived in Paris since 1951, and more recently in Suffolk, England.

Plaskett's 90th birthday occurred in 2008. To celebrate, exhibitions were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. Plaskett continues to paint daily and his work is held in many collections worldwide.
