Taisto Kalevi Sorsa (December 21, 1930 – January 16, 2004) was a Finnish politician who was Prime Minister of Finland four times: 1972–1975, 1977–1979, 1982–1983 and 1983–1987 and at the date of his death still held the Finnish record of most days of incumbency as prime minister. He was also a long-time leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland.
Kalevi Sorsa went to school in Jyväskylä and Lappeenranta. Sorsa started participating in SDP politics in Lappeenranta 1948. In 1969, Sorsa was brought in from relative obscurity by Rafael Paasio to assume the influential post of party secretary without much previous experience of national politics.
Before his political career Sorsa worked for UNESCO in Paris 1959–1965, and was Secretary-General of Finnish UNESCO board 1965–1969, and official in the Ministry of Education 1967–1969.
Sorsa was one of the major political figures during presidencies of Kekkonen and Koivisto. Sorsa was the chairman of Social Democratic Party from 1969 to 1975 and Prime Minister of Finland of four cabinets for about 10 years total (1972–1975, 1977–1979, 1982–1983, 1983–1987). He still holds the record of the longest-serving prime minister. He was the Speaker of Parliament from 1989 to 1991, and Deputy Prime Minister 1975–1976 and 1987–1989.
Sorsa is regarded as one of the most influential prime ministers of Finland. Sorsa's contribution was important both for public services such as schools and health care reforms, as well as the strengthening of social security for both families with children and pensioners. His governments took a number of domestic policy reforms (including the law on child care, the extension of maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act). Sorsa's governments strengthened the Finnish welfare state.
Sorsa also participated actively in the international social democratic movement. He supported the OSCE process, as well as the projects to bridge the gap between world's rich and poor countries. Despite the opposition of far-left parties, Sorsa supported the EEC free trade agreement in the 1970s, which would have made the ties between Finland and EEC countries closer. The agreement eventually got confirmed. Of the politicians of his era, he had the most difficult relationship with Paavo Väyrynen, an equally strongwilled opponent at the helm of the Center Party. Another notable prolonged conflict was a rivalry with the young Paavo Lipponen on his way up.
He met Soviet Premier Nikolai Tikhonov during his state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984.
In later years of his career, Sorsa went into his Social Democratic Party's primary elections as candidate for president in 1993, but was defeated in a humiliating way by the relatively unknown international civil servant Martti Ahtisaari. Sorsa had collected inside his party a small, but significant amount of enemies over the years. They were among others Erkki Tuomioja, Lasse Lehtinen and Matti Ahde. Sorsa replaced Ahde as Speaker in 1989. They all became influential forces behind Martti Ahtisaari campaign.
Kalevi Sorsa died of cancer on January 16, 2004 at his home in Helsinki. He participated in discussion of social politics until his last days. His last column was published posthumously.
The Kalevi Sorsa Foundation is a social democratic think tank named in his honour.
