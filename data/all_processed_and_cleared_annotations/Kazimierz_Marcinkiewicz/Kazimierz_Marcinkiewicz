Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz (Polish pronunciation:&#160; &#160; ) (born December 20, 1959 in Gorzów Wielkopolski) is a Polish conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland from October 31, 2005 to July 14, 2006. He was a member of the Law and Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS).
Marcinkiewicz graduated in 1984 from the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry (having studied physics) of the Wrocław University. He also completed post-graduate course in Administration at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. He worked as an elementary school teacher and a headmaster in his homecity of Gorzów Wielkopolski.
In the 1980s, he was also a member of the Solidarity movement and editor of underground press materials. In 1992, he became a State Secretary (formal name for deputy minister) in the Ministry of National Education. From 1999 to 2000, he was the cabinet chief for prime minister Jerzy Buzek.
Following the victory of the Law and Justice party in the September 2005 Polish parliamentary elections, its prime ministerial candidate, party leader Jarosław Kaczyński decided against becoming prime minister so as not to damage the chances of his twin brother, Lech Kaczyński in the then-upcoming October presidential election. Instead the little-known Marcinkiewicz became PM, leading a coalition formed by Jarosław, who remained in the background, but influential.
Before his prime ministerial appointment, Marcinkiewicz remained a political cipher, which resulted in a political carte blanche after the appointment. Relatively unknown to the public at that time, due to his intensive political activity Marcinkiewicz gained a high public recognition, rapidly becoming the most trusted and popular politician in Poland.

Marcinkiewicz strongly supports Polish membership in EU, although he disagrees with several more integrationist ideas, such as the European Constitution. Economic policy of his cabinet is a continuation of those conducted by previous governments.
Following speculations of a rift with Jarosław Kaczyński, Marcinkiewicz tendered his resignation on July 7, 2006, maintaining however that no one will insert a wedge between him and Kaczyński, words he directed at Donald Tusk. He was succeeded as prime minister on July 14 by Kaczyński.
On July 18, Marcinkiewicz was appointed as the temporary acting mayor of Warsaw, a so-called "comissar". During the municipal elections in 2006, he was the Law and Justice candidate for mayor of Warsaw. In the first round of voting, held on November 12, he got 38.42%, while his closest rival, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz of the opposition Civic Platform won 34.15% of the votes. In the second round, held on November 26, he got 46.82% of the votes, thus losing the elections. Since March 1, 2007 he is one of the directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In the first half of 2009 he came under heavy criticism because of not keeping up with the moral values he promoted while being engaged in politics. In particular, it was discovered that he was criticizing extra-marital affairs and praising traditional family values, while at the same time in his personal actions he followed a contrary way. He submitted the material about his private life to the press himself gaining wide press coverage.
