Yılmaz managed to discharge <a href="/wiki/Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m_Akbulut" title="Yıldırım Akbulut">Akbulut</a> from party leadership and from all executive functions during the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Biennial" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Biennial">biennial</a> party congress in June 1991. Because ANAP had the majority in the <a href="/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey" title="Grand National Assembly of Turkey">parliament</a> he subsequently became <a href="/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Turkey" title="List of Prime Ministers of Turkey">Prime Minister of Turkey</a>.
The following years saw a decline in the popularity of the Motherland Party and an acrimonious relationship with <a href="/wiki/Tansu_%C3%87iller" title="Tansu Çiller">Tansu Çiller</a>, leader of the center-right <a href="/wiki/True_Path_Party" title="True Path Party" class="mw-redirect">True Path Party</a> (DYP). Yılmaz also made the Motherland Party more business-friendly and Europe-oriented, causing the more conservative, religious wing to switch to the <a href="/wiki/Welfare_Party" title="Welfare Party">Welfare Party</a> (RP) of <a href="/wiki/Necmettin_Erbakan" title="Necmettin Erbakan">Necmettin Erbakan</a>.
His term was marked by the <a href="/wiki/Susurluk_scandal" title="Susurluk scandal">Susurluk scandal</a>, during which he admitted the existence of the <a href="/wiki/J%C4%B0TEM" title="JİTEM">JİTEM</a> counter-terrorist Gendarmerie unit.

Yılmaz' concerns over his own safety, owing to his support of the Susurluk investigation, led to his briefly carrying a gun in self-defense.
In October 1998, he set off a furor in the <a href="/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a> by threatening to "poke out the eyes" of <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a> over <a href="/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" title="Hafez al-Assad">Hafez al-Assad</a>'s alleged support of the separatist <a href="/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party" title="Kurdistan Workers' Party">Kurdistan Workers' Party</a>.
Yılmaz's last stint as Prime Minister ended in 1999.
