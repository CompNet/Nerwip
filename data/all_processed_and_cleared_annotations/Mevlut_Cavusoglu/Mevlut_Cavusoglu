Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (born 5 February 1968, Alanya, Turkey) is the current president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He also represents Antalya Province in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. First elected to Parliament in the 2002 general election, he is a founding member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). .
Çavuşoğlu graduated from Ankara University in 1988 where he studied international relations. He then received a masters in economics from Long Island University in New York, and doctorates from Bilkent University and the London School of Economics, where he was for a time president of the Turkish Society. He is married with one child.
While serving in parliament, he has chaired the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population. In November 2009 he met the foreign minister of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, in the context of a report that the Assembly is preparing on the Soviet famine of 1932–1933.
Çavuşoğlu joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 2003 and soon after was named the head of the Turkish delegation and a vice-president of the Assembly. During the January 2010 session of the Assembly he was nominated and elected on January 25, 2010 to replace outgoing President Lluís Maria De Puig of Spain. In the October reshuffle, this was the reason given for why he did not receive extra responsibilities in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government. His candidacy for this post was supported by all of Turkey's main parties. He became president just months before Turkey takes up the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (November 2010) and at the same time that there was a Turkish president of the Congress of the Council of Europe.
