Little is known of the life of Nehemiah Ford. His presence in Hamilton is recorded in 1839, when he was a member of the executive of the first <a href="/wiki/Mechanic" title="Mechanic">Mechanics</a>' Institute of Wentworth County. He served as its recording secretary for several years, and was made an honorary member on February 25, 1848 as a reward for his services. A painter by trade, as well as a <a href="/wiki/Freemason" title="Freemason" class="mw-redirect">freemason</a>, Ford was also a member of both Barton <a href="/wiki/Masonic_Lodge" title="Masonic Lodge">Lodge</a> and the Church of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_the_Apostle" title="Thomas the Apostle">St. Thomas</a>.

Ford was elected mayor in 1852, and his term of office was unusual. Problems arose when Ford agreed to allow John Gamble Geddes to use the <a href="/wiki/James_Street_(Hamilton, _Ontario)" title="James Street (Hamilton, Ontario)">James Street</a> council chambers for a meeting of the Gore and Wellington Church Society. Unfortunately, the time chosen coincided with a scheduled council meeting, and, when Ford agreed to change the time of the municipal meeting, he caused considerable friction. The council criticized his conduct but agreed to vote him the Â£100 salary for his year's services as mayor. Ford refused to accept the salary with <a href="/wiki/Censure" title="Censure">censure</a> and brought the affair to public attention. Although the matter was later smoothed over, Ford refused to run for a second term.
