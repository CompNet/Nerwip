Osman Hamdi Bey (1842&#160; – 24 February 1910) was an <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> statesman, intellectual, art expert and also a prominent and pioneering <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" title="Turkish people">Turkish</a> painter. He was also an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Archaeologist" title="Archaeologist" class="mw-redirect">archaeologist</a>, and is considered as the pioneer of the <a href="/wiki/Curator" title="Curator">museum curator</a>'s profession in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. He was the founder of <a href="/wiki/Istanbul_Archaeology_Museums" title="Istanbul Archaeology Museums">Istanbul Archaeology Museums</a> and of İstanbul Academy of Fine Arts (<a href="//tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanayi-i_Nefise_Mektebi" class="extiw" title="tr:Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi">Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turkish_language" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>), known today as the <a href="/wiki/Mimar_Sinan_University_of_Fine_Arts" title="Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts">Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts</a>.
Osman Hamdi was the son of <a href="/wiki/%C4%B0brahim_Edhem_Pasha" title="İbrahim Edhem Pasha" class="mw-redirect">İbrahim Edhem Pasha</a> a former Grand Vizier who was a <a href="/wiki/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greek</a> boy from the island of <a href="/wiki/Chios" title="Chios">Chios</a> orphaned at a very young age following the 1821 Greek uprising there. He was adopted by Kaptan-I Derya Husrev Pasha and eventually rising to the ranks of the ruling class of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.
Osman Hamdi went to primary school in the popular Constantinople quarter of <a href="/wiki/Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F" title="Beşiktaş">Beşiktaş</a>, after which he studied Law, first in Istanbul (1856), and then in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> (1860). However, he decided to pursue his interest in painting instead, left the law program, and trained under French orientalist painters <a href="/wiki/Jean-L%C3%A9on_G%C3%A9r%C3%B4me" title="Jean-Léon Gérôme">Jean-Léon Gérôme</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Boulanger" title="Gustave Boulanger">Gustave Boulanger</a>. During his nine-year stay in Paris, the international capital of fine arts in that period, he showed a keen interest for the artistic events of his day. He also met many of the <a href="/wiki/Young_Turks" title="Young Turks">Young Turks</a> and though exposed to their liberal ideas, as the son of a loyal Ottoman Paşa, did not participate in their activities.
Osman Hamdi also met his first wife Maria, a French woman, in Paris when he was a student. After receiving his father's blessings, she accompanied him to Constantinople when he returned in 1869, where the two got married and had two daughters.
His stay in Paris was also marked with the first visit ever by an Ottoman sultan to Europe where <a href="/wiki/Abd%C3%BClaziz" title="Abdülaziz">Abdülaziz</a> was invited to the <a href="/wiki/Exposition_Universelle_(1867)" title="Exposition Universelle (1867)">Exposition Universelle (1867)</a> by <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France" title="Napoleon III of France" class="mw-redirect">Emperor Napoleon III</a>.
Once back in Turkey, he was sent to the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> province of <a href="/wiki/Baghdad" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, as part of the administrative team of <a href="/wiki/Midhat_Pasa" title="Midhat Pasa" class="mw-redirect">Midhat Pasa</a>, who would later become an important reformer of the <a href="/wiki/Tanzimat" title="Tanzimat">Tanzimat</a>. In 1871, he returned to Constantinople, as the vice-director of the Protocol Office of the Palace. During the 1870s, he worked on several assignments in the upper echelons of the Ottoman bureaucracy.
Osman Hamdi exhibited three paintings at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle. None seem to have survived today, but their titles were Repose of the Gypsies, Black Sea Soldier Lying in Wait, and Death of the Soldier. An important step in his career was his assignment as the director of the Imperial Museum (Müze-i Hümayun) in 1881. He used his position as museum director to develop the museum and rewrite the antiquities laws and to create nationally sponsored archaeological expeditions. In 1882, he instituted and became director of the Academy of Fine Arts, which provided Ottomans with training in aesthetics and artistic techniques without leaving the empire. In 1884, he oversaw the promulgation of a Regulation prohibiting historical artifacts from being smuggled abroad (Asar-ı Atîka Nizamnamesi), a giant step in constituting a legal framework of preservation of the antiquities. Representatives or middlemen of 19th century European Powers routinely smuggled artifacts with historical value from within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which then comprised the geographies of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamian" title="Mesopotamian" class="mw-redirect">Mesopotamian</a> civilizations, among others), often resorting to shadily obtained licenses or bribes, to enrich museums in European capitals.
He conducted the first scientific based archaeological researches done by a Turkish team. His digs included sites as varied as the <a href="/wiki/Commagene" title="Commagene" class="mw-redirect">Commagene</a> tomb-sanctuary in <a href="/wiki/Nemrut_Da%C4%9F%C4%B1" title="Nemrut Dağı" class="mw-redirect">Nemrut Dağı</a> in southeastern <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> (a top tourist's venue in Turkey and a <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> today, within the <a href="/wiki/Ad%C4%B1yaman_Province" title="Adıyaman Province">Adıyaman Province</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Hekate" title="Hekate" class="mw-redirect">Hekate</a> <a href="/wiki/Sanctuary" title="Sanctuary">sanctuary</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lagina" title="Lagina">Lagina</a> in southwestern Anatolia (also much visited, and within the <a href="/wiki/Mu%C4%9Fla_Province" title="Muğla Province">Muğla Province</a> today), and <a href="/wiki/Sidon" title="Sidon">Sidon</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Sarcophagus" title="Sarcophagus">sarcophagi</a> he discovered in Sidon (including the one known as the Alexander Sarcophagus, although this sarcophagus is thought to contain the remains of a Persian noble who was also the governor of Babylon.) are considered among the worldwide jewels of archaeological findings. To lodge these, he started building what is today the <a href="/wiki/Istanbul_Archaeology_Museum" title="Istanbul Archaeology Museum" class="mw-redirect">Istanbul Archaeology Museum</a> in 1881. The museum officially opened in 1891 under his directorship.
Throughout his professional career as museum and academy director, Osman Hamdi continued to paint in the style of his teachers, Gérôme and Boulanger.
His 1906 painting, "<a href="/wiki/The_Tortoise_Trainer" title="The Tortoise Trainer">The Tortoise Trainer</a>", recently broke a record in Turkey by being sold for the amount of 3.5 million <a href="/wiki/Dollars" title="Dollars" class="mw-redirect">dollars</a> in December 2004. The painting expresses a sarcastic <a href="/wiki/Innuendo" title="Innuendo">innuendo</a> on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminative and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the <a href="/wiki/Tulip_Era_in_the_Ottoman_Empire" title="Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire" class="mw-redirect">Tulip Era</a> in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation and is currently on display at the <a href="/wiki/Pera_Museum" title="Pera Museum">Pera Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/%C4%B0stanbul" title="İstanbul" class="mw-redirect">İstanbul</a>, which was established by this foundation.
Modern researchers have identified the animals portrayed are <a href="/wiki/Testudo_graeca" title="Testudo graeca" class="mw-redirect">Testudo graeca</a> ibera, a variety of the Spur-thighed Tortoise. A reproduction of the painting appeared on the cover of the <a href="/wiki/Bibliotheca_Herpetologica" title="Bibliotheca Herpetologica">Bibliotheca Herpetologica</a> issue in which the paper about the identification was published.
