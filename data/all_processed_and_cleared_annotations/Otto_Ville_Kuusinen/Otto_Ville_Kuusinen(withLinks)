Kuusinen was born to the family of village tailor Wilhelm Juhonpoika Kuusinen in <a href="/wiki/Laukaa" title="Laukaa">Laukaa</a> in 1881. His mother died when Kuusinen was two years old, and the family then moved to <a href="/wiki/Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4" title="Jyväskylä">Jyväskylä</a>. Kuusinen graduated from the Jyväskylä in May 1900 and entered <a href="/wiki/Helsinki_University" title="Helsinki University" class="mw-redirect">Helsinki University</a> the same year. His main subjects were <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Art_history" title="Art history">art history</a>. Kuusinen was an active member of the students' union, and during this period he was interested in <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Party" title="Finnish Party">Fennoman conservatism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Santeri_Alkio" title="Santeri Alkio">Alkioism</a>. Kuusinen graduated as a <a href="/wiki/Candidate_of_Philosophy" title="Candidate of Philosophy">Candidate of Philosophy</a> in 1902.
After toppling the more moderate party chairman J. K. Kari in 1906, Kuusinen came to dominate <a href="/wiki/Finland%27s_Social_Democratic_Party" title="Finland's Social Democratic Party" class="mw-redirect">Finland's Social Democratic Party</a>. He was a member of <a href="/wiki/Eduskunta" title="Eduskunta" class="mw-redirect">Finland's Parliament</a> 1908–1913 and the party's chairman 1911–1917. He was a leader of the January 1918 revolution in Finland that created the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Socialist_Workers%27_Republic" title="Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic">Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic</a>, of which he was appointed People's Commissar of Education. After the republic was defeated in the <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Civil_War" title="Finnish Civil War">Finnish Civil War</a> in 1918, Kuusinen fled to <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and helped form the <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Communist_Party" title="Finnish Communist Party" class="mw-redirect">Finnish Communist Party</a>.
He continued his work as a prominent leader of the <a href="/wiki/Comintern" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> in Bolshevist Russia, that soon became the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Kuusinen also became a leader in <a href="/wiki/GRU" title="GRU">Soviet military intelligence</a>, establishing an intelligence network against the Scandinavian countries. In Finland, a more moderate faction rehabilitated the Social Democrats under <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A4in%C3%B6_Tanner" title="Väinö Tanner">Väinö Tanner</a>'s leadership. Meanwhile, Kuusinen and other radicals were increasingly seen as responsible for the Civil War and its aftermath.
Animosity towards Socialists in Finland in the decades after the Civil War prompted many Finns to emigrate to Russia to "build Socialism." However, the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a> was a hard blow against Finns in the Soviet Union — most of those who didn't escape back to Finland were executed as unreliable in the 1930s — and Kuusinen's reputation in Finland was further damaged when he turned out to be one of the very few not targeted by <a href="/wiki/Stalinist" title="Stalinist" class="mw-redirect">Stalinist</a> <a href="/wiki/Show_trial" title="Show trial">show trials</a>, deportations, and executions.
When the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> began its advance during the <a href="/wiki/Winter_War" title="Winter War">Winter War</a> on November 30, 1939, Kuusinen was pronounced head of the <a href="/wiki/Finnish_Democratic_Republic" title="Finnish Democratic Republic">Finnish Democratic Republic</a> (also known as the Terijoki Government)—<a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Puppet_r%C3%A9gime" title="Puppet régime" class="mw-redirect">puppet régime</a> intended to rule Finland. A "Declaration of the People's Government of Finland" was issued in Terijoki on December 1, 1939, and a "Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Friendship Between the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Finland" signed by Molotov and Kuusinen in Moscow on December 2, 1939 However, the war did not go as planned, and the Soviet leadership decided to negotiate a peace with the Finnish government; Kuusinen's government was quietly disbanded and he was made chairman of the presidium of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet" title="Supreme Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Karelo-Finnish_SSR" title="Karelo-Finnish SSR" class="mw-redirect">Karelo-Finnish SSR</a> (1940–1956).
From the very outset of the war, <a href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class" class="mw-redirect">working-class</a> Finns stood behind the legal government in Helsinki. Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the <a href="/wiki/Spirit_of_the_Winter_War" title="Spirit of the Winter War">spirit of the Winter War</a>.
Kuusinen became an influential official in the Soviet state administration. He was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Politburo" title="Politburo">Politburo</a>, the highest state organ.

In 1952 and again in 1957 he was also elected to the Presidium of the Central Committee.
Kuusinen was one of the editors of <a href="/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Marxism-Leninism" title="Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" class="mw-redirect">The Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism</a>, considered to be one of the fundamental works on <a href="/wiki/Dialectical_materialism" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leninism" title="Leninism">Leninist</a> <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Kremlin" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> politics he was considered a liberal — and from its temporal distance his thinking pointed forward to <a href="/wiki/Perestroika" title="Perestroika">perestroika</a>. While editing a new party programme for "rapid agricultural, industrial, and technological development" he championed giving up the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="Dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, to the horror of more conservative ideologists. In this he was supported by Khrushchev.
Kuusinen was elected a member of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Soviet Academy of Sciences" class="mw-redirect">Soviet Academy of Sciences</a> in 1958.
