Petar Bojović OKS GCMG (Serbian: , pronounced&#160; ; July 16, 1858 in Miševići, Nova Varoš – January 20, 1945 in Belgrade) was one of four Serbian vojvodas (field-marshals) in Balkan Wars and World War I.
Petar was born on July 16, 1858 in Miševići, Nova Varoš. He had distant ancestry from the Vasojevići.
He fought in Serbian-Ottoman Wars from 1876 to 1878 as a cadet of the Artillery school, as well as in wars that Serbia waged at the beginning of the 20th century. He was Chief of the General Staff for the first time from 1905 to 1908.
In the Balkan Wars, he was the Chief of Staff of the 1st Army, which scored huge success in battles of Kumanovo, Bitola (First Balkan War) and Bregalnica (Second Balkan War). He took part in peace negotiations with Turkey, held in London in 1913, as a military expert in the Serbian Government delegation.
At the start of World War I, he was given command of the 1st Army. His army suffered huge losses at Battle of Drina, but managed to stop the Austro-Hungarian offensive. Bojović was wounded in the battle, and was replaced at the army general position by Živojin Mišić. In January 1916, he was appointed Chief of General Staff for a second time in place of the ailing vojvoda Radomir Putnik, who was carried by his soldiers to the city of Skadar. He held that position until June 1918, when he resigned because of dispute with the allied generals on the issue of widening of Thessaloniki Front. He returned to his position Commander of the 1st Army, which broke the enemy lines and advanced deep into the occupied territory. He received the title of vojvoda on September 26, 1918 for his contribution during the war.
In 1921, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, and in 1922 he withdrew from active service. At the very beginning of World War II, Petar Bojovic was appointed Assistant to the Commander-in-Chief of the Yugoslavian Armed Forces, the young King Petar II Karađorđević. However, because of his old age, he did not participate in the events that followed.
