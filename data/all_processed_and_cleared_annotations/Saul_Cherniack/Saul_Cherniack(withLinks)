Cherniack's father, J. Alter Cherniack, was a prominent member of Winnipeg's Jewish community and leading supporter of the <a href="/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party_(in_Manitoba)_(II)" title="Independent Labour Party (in Manitoba) (II)" class="mw-redirect">Independent Labour Party</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation" title="Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation" class="mw-redirect">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> in the city's north end. Cherniack is related to <a href="/wiki/David_Orlikow" title="David Orlikow">David Orlikow</a>.
Cherniack was educated at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Manitoba" title="University of Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> (receiving a law degree in 1939), and was active in the <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation" title="Cooperative Commonwealth Federation" class="mw-redirect">Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> community of <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>. He began practising law in 1940. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the Royal Canadian Artillery and then in the Intelligence Corps of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Army" title="Canadian Army">Canadian Army</a> as a Japanese language specialist, reaching the rank of captain. After the war, he practised as a barrister and solicitor. He was a trustee on the <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg_School_Board" title="Winnipeg School Board" class="mw-redirect">Winnipeg School Board</a> from 1950 to 1954, a councillor in the town of <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg_Beach, _Manitoba" title="Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba">Winnipeg Beach</a> in 1958-59, a Winnipeg alderman in 1959-60, and a councillor on the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg from 1960 to 1962.
He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1962" title="Manitoba general election, 1962">1962 provincial election</a>, in the north-end Winnipeg riding of <a href="/wiki/St._Johns_(Manitoba_riding)" title="St. Johns (Manitoba riding)" class="mw-redirect">St. Johns</a>. He was re-elected in the elections of <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1966" title="Manitoba general election, 1966">1966</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1969" title="Manitoba general election, 1969">1969</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1973" title="Manitoba general election, 1973">1973</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1977" title="Manitoba general election, 1977">1977</a>, each time by a significant margin.
In 1968-69, Cherniack was a key figure in the provincial NDP calling for <a href="/wiki/Edward_Schreyer" title="Edward Schreyer">Edward Schreyer</a> to replace <a href="/wiki/Russell_Paulley" title="Russell Paulley">Russell Paulley</a> as party leader. He initially considered challenging Paulley himself, but declined, reportedly on the advice of NDP research adviser <a href="/wiki/Doug_Rowland" title="Doug Rowland">Doug Rowland</a>. Those who supported <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Green_(politician)" title="Sidney Green (politician)">Sidney Green</a> contended that Cherniack did not run because of concerns that a Jewish party leader would not have been acceptable to the general public in the late 1960s; they later attributed his lack of support for Green to the same reason. (<a href="/wiki/Russell_Doern" title="Russell Doern">Russell Doern</a> once quoted Cherniack as saying "I do not believe that Manitoba is ready for a Jewish Premier" in announcing his decision to others in the party.) Cherniack denied that, saying that his decision not to run himself was based on his lack of ambition for power, and his support of Schreyer was based on Schreyer's leadership qualities.
When Sidney Green challenged Paulley for the party leadership in late 1968, Cherniack and seven other MLAs supported Paulley on condition that he stand down the following year in favour of Schreyer. Paulley was confirmed as leader and resigned the following year, at which time Schreyer defeated Green for the party leadership. The NDP under Schreyer formed a <a href="/wiki/Minority_government" title="Minority government">minority government</a> following the 1969 election.
On July 17, 1969, Cherniack was appointed provincial <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_Minister_of_Finance" title="Manitoba Minister of Finance" class="mw-redirect">Minister of Finance</a>. He was also given the <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_Minister_of_Urban_Affairs" title="Manitoba Minister of Urban Affairs" class="mw-redirect">Urban Affairs</a> portfolio for a brief period in 1970, and was responsible for amalgamating the suburbs and inner city of Winnipeg into one large municipality, the first such unification in <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. He remained one of Schreyer's most trusted confidantes throughout the 1970s.
During his time in office, Cherniack was respected for his intellectual rigour and integrity, and was known as one of the most dignified members of the Manitoba Assembly. He resigned the finance portfolio on November 13, 1972, returned to office on May 2, 1973, and resigned a second time in January 1975.
When Edward Schreyer resigned as party leader in 1979, Cherniack offered to serve as interim leader until a party convention could be held. He set a number of conditions to this offer, however; those who supported Green contended that he was trying to secure the leadership for either himself or <a href="/wiki/Wilson_Parasiuk" title="Wilson Parasiuk">Wilson Parasiuk</a>. At a caucus vote Green and <a href="/wiki/Howard_Pawley" title="Howard Pawley">Howard Pawley</a> contested Cherniack's interim leadership, and he received only three votes for the position of interim leader. Howard Pawley, the successful candidate, subsequently named him as the party's deputy leader.
Cherniack announced his retirement from political life in October 1980, saying "I am selfish enough to want a little more private life and have for some time [...] There comes a time in a person's life when he has a right to say I want to be relieved of the burden". Cherniack criticized the Manitoba New Democratic Party's recent leadership divisions in making his announcement, arguing that personality questions were obscuring substantive issues. He remained a member of the legislature until the <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1981" title="Manitoba general election, 1981">1981 election</a>.
After his retirement from politics, Cherniack became chair of <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_Hydro" title="Manitoba Hydro">Manitoba Hydro</a>, and served as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Security_Intelligence_Review_Committee" title="Security Intelligence Review Committee">Security Intelligence Review Committee</a> overseeing the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service" title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> from 1984 to 1992. Accordingly, he was sworn in to the <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada" title="Queen's Privy Council for Canada">Queen's Privy Council for Canada</a> on November 30, 1984 to enable him access to information restricted under the Official Secrets Act.
Cherniack has also served as national vice-president of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Jewish_Congress" title="Canadian Jewish Congress">Canadian Jewish Congress</a>. He retired from his legal practice in 2000.
In the <a href="/wiki/Manitoba_general_election, _1999" title="Manitoba general election, 1999">1999 provincial election</a>, his son Lawrie Cherniack ran for the NDP in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Garry_(Manitoba_riding)" title="Fort Garry (Manitoba riding)" class="mw-redirect">Fort Garry</a> against <a href="/wiki/Joy_Smith" title="Joy Smith">Joy Smith</a>, and lost by only 30 votes.
In 2003, he supported <a href="/wiki/Bill_Blaikie" title="Bill Blaikie">Bill Blaikie</a>'s campaign to lead the federal <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a>.
