In 2006â€“2011 the city administration has been criticized by some members of the local press on issues relating to infrastructure maintenance.
In September 2007, Mandel ordered the removal from city property of work by Edmonton sculptor Ryan McCourt, after receiving a 700-name petition that alleged McCourt's sculptures had "hurt Hindu religious sensibilities".
