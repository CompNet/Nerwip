Traian Lalescu (Romanian pronunciation:&#160; ; 12 July 1882, Bucharest–15 June 1929, Bucharest) was a Romanian mathematician. His main focus was on integral equations and he contributed to work in the areas of functional equations, trigonometric series, mathematical physics, geometry, mechanics, algebra, and the history of mathematics.
He went to the Carol I High School in Craiova, continuing high school in Roman and Iaşi. After entering the University of Iaşi, he completed his undergraduate studies in 1903 at the University of Bucharest.
He earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Paris in 1908. His dissertation, Sur les équations de Volterra, was written under the direction of Émile Picard. In 1911, he published Introduction to the Theory of Integral Equations, the first book ever on the subject of integral equations.
He was a professor at the University of Bucharest, the Polytechnic University of Timişoara (where he was the first rector, in 1920), and the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.
There are several institutions bearing his name, including Colegiul Naţional de Informatică Traian Lalescu in Hunedoara and Liceul Teoretic Traian Lalescu in Reşiţa. There is also a Traian Lalescu Street in Timişoara. The National Mathematics Contest Traian Lalescu for undergraduate students is also named after him.
A statue of Lalescu, executed in 1930 by Cornel Medrea, is situated in front of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, in Timişoara.
