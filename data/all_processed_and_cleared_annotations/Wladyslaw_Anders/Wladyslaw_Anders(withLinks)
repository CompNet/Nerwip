<a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-General" title="Lieutenant-General" class="mw-redirect">Lieutenant-General</a> Władysław Anders <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath" title="Order of the Bath">CB</a> (11 August 1892 – 12 May 1970) was a <a href="/wiki/General" title="General" class="mw-redirect">General</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Polish</a> <a href="/wiki/Army" title="Army">Army</a> and later in life a <a href="/wiki/Politician" title="Politician">politician</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" title="Polish government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> in London.
Anders was born on 11 August 1892 to his <a href="/wiki/Baltic-German" title="Baltic-German" class="mw-redirect">Baltic-German</a> father Albert Anders and his mother Elizabeth, born Tauchert, in the Polish village of <a href="/wiki/Kro%C5%9Bniewice" title="Krośniewice">Krośniewice</a>–Błonie, near <a href="/wiki/Kutno" title="Kutno">Kutno</a> which at that time was part of the Russian Empire (<a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" title="Partitions of Poland">Partitions of Poland</a>). He was baptized as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a> <a href="/wiki/Evangelical-Augsburg_Church_in_Poland" title="Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland" class="mw-redirect">Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland</a>; but while being kept in Soviet prisons he made a promise that if he survived and regained strength in his legs (he was seriously injured) he would convert to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholicism</a>. He did survive, and did indeed convert.
While an undergraduate at <a href="/wiki/Riga_Technical_University" title="Riga Technical University">Riga Technical University</a> Anders became a member of the Polish student fraternity Arkonia. As a young <a href="/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)" title="Officer (armed forces)">officer</a>, he served <a href="/wiki/Tsar" title="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II</a> in the 1st Krechowiecki Lancer's Regiment during World War I, later joining the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Army" title="Polish Army" class="mw-redirect">Polish Army</a> and again serving in cavalry as a <a href="/wiki/Commanding_officer" title="Commanding officer">commanding officer</a> in <a href="/wiki/15th_Pozna%C5%84_Uhlans_Regiment" title="15th Poznań Uhlans Regiment">15th Poznań Uhlans Regiment</a>.
Anders was in command of a cavalry <a href="/wiki/Brigade" title="Brigade">brigade</a> at the time of the outbreak of World War II. The Polish army at that time had not yet had a chance to fully modernise, having been resurrected only 20 years earlier, in 1918–19, following Polish independence from German, Austrian and Russian rule. Polish forces were not matched with the larger German forces and their <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a> tactics, and the Polish forces were forced to retreat to the east. During the fighting and retreat he was wounded a number of times. Anders was later taken prisoner by <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> forces and was jailed, initially in Lvov (then Lwów) and later in <a href="/wiki/Lubyanka_(KGB)" title="Lubyanka (KGB)" class="mw-redirect">Lubyanka</a> prison in Moscow. During his imprisonment Anders was tortured.
Shortly after the attack on the Soviet Union by Germany on 22 June 1941, Anders was released by the <a href="/wiki/Soviets" title="Soviets" class="mw-redirect">Soviets</a> with the aim of forming a Polish Army to fight alongside the Red Army. Continued friction with the Soviets over political issues as well as shortages of weapons, food and clothing, led to the eventual exodus of Anders' men – known as the <a href="/wiki/Anders_Army" title="Anders Army" class="mw-redirect">Anders Army</a> – together with a sizeable contingent of Polish civilians via the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Corridor" title="Persian Corridor">Persian Corridor</a> into <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palestine" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>. Here, Anders formed and led the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Polish_Corps" title="2nd Polish Corps" class="mw-redirect">2nd Polish Corps</a>, fighting alongside the Western Allies, while agitating for the release of Polish nationals still in the Soviet Union.
Anders was the commander of the 2nd Polish Corps in Italy 1943–1946, capturing Monte Cassino in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino" title="Battle of Monte Cassino">Battle of Monte Cassino</a>.
After the war the Soviet-installed <a href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist" class="mw-redirect">communist</a> <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a> in Poland in 1946 deprived him of Polish <a href="/wiki/Citizenship" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> and of his military rank. Anders had, however, always been unwilling to return to a Soviet-dominated Poland where he probably would have been jailed and possibly executed, and remained in exile in Britain. He was prominent in the Polish Government in Exile in London and <a href="/wiki/General_Inspector_of_the_Armed_Forces" title="General Inspector of the Armed Forces">inspector-general of the Polish forces-in-exile</a>. He died in London on 12 May 1970, where his body <a href="/wiki/Lying_in_state" title="Lying in state">lay in state</a> at the church of <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_Bobola" title="Andrzej Bobola" class="mw-redirect">Andrzej Bobola</a>, where many of his former soldiers and families came to pay their last respects. He was buried, in accordance with his wishes, amongst his fallen soldiers from the 2nd Polish Corps at the <a href="/wiki/Polish_cemetery_at_Monte_Cassino" title="Polish cemetery at Monte Cassino">Polish War Cemetery</a> at <a href="/wiki/Monte_Cassino" title="Monte Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> in Italy.
After the war Anders wrote a book covering his thoughts and experiences. An Army in Exile was published originally by MacMillan &amp; Co., London, in 1949. The book has been recently re-issued under the same title.
In 1948 he married the actress <a href="/wiki/Irena_Anders" title="Irena Anders">Irena Anders</a>.
After the collapse of Communist Poland in 1989, his citizenship and military rank were posthumously reinstated.
