He is sometimes referred to as the first <a href="/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="List of heads of state of the Soviet Union">head of state of the Soviet Union</a> but this is not correct since the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> came into existence in 1922, three years after Sverdlov's death.
