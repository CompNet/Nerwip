Adolf Hitler (German: &#160; ; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an <a href="/wiki/Austria%E2%80%93Hungary" title="Austria–Hungary" class="mw-redirect">Austrian</a>-born <a href="/wiki/Germans" title="Germans">German</a> politician and the leader of the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Party" title="Nazi Party">National Socialist German Workers Party</a> (<a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a>: (NSDAP), commonly referred to as the Nazi Party). He was from 1933 to 1945, and <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a> (as <a href="/wiki/F%C3%BChrer" title="Führer">Führer und Reichskanzler</a>) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler is most commonly associated with the rise of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a> in Europe, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.
A decorated veteran of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Hitler joined the <a href="/wiki/German_Workers%27_Party" title="German Workers' Party">German Workers' Party</a>, precursor of the Nazi Party, in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923 Hitler attempted a coup d'état, known as the <a href="/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch" title="Beer Hall Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/B%C3%BCrgerbr%C3%A4ukeller" title="Bürgerbräukeller">Bürgerbräukeller</a> <a href="/wiki/Beer_hall" title="Beer hall">beer hall</a> in Munich. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, <a href="/wiki/Mein_Kampf" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained support by promoting <a href="/wiki/Pan-Germanism" title="Pan-Germanism">Pan-Germanism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Anti-communism" title="Anti-communism">anti-communism</a> with <a href="/wiki/Charismatic_authority" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> <a href="/wiki/Oratory" title="Oratory" class="mw-redirect">oratory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nazi_propaganda" title="Nazi propaganda">propaganda</a>. He was appointed chancellor in 1933 and transformed the <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Third Reich</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Single-party_state" title="Single-party state">single-party</a> dictatorship based on the <a href="/wiki/Totalitarianism" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Autocratic" title="Autocratic" class="mw-redirect">autocratic</a> ideology of <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>.
Hitler's avowed aim was to establish a <a href="/wiki/New_Order_(Nazism)" title="New Order (Nazism)">New Order</a> of absolute Nazi German <a href="/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> in continental Europe. His foreign and domestic policies had the goal of seizing <a href="/wiki/Lebensraum" title="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a> (living space) for the <a href="/wiki/Nazism_and_race" title="Nazism and race">Germanic people</a>. He oversaw the rearmament of Germany and the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland" title="Invasion of Poland">invasion of Poland</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> in September 1939, which led to the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II" title="European Theatre of World War II">World War II in Europe</a>.
Under Hitler's direction, German forces and their <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">European allies</a> at one point occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were reversed in 1945 when the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied armies</a> defeated the German army. Hitler's policies resulted in the systematic annihilation of as many as 17&#160; million civilians, including an estimated six million Jews targeted in <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and between 500, 000 and 1, 500, 000 <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" title="Romani people">Roma</a>.
In the final days of the war, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin" title="Battle of Berlin">Battle of Berlin</a> in 1945, Hitler married <a href="/wiki/Eva_Braun" title="Eva Braun">Eva Braun</a>, his long-time mistress. To avoid capture by the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>, the two <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler" title="Death of Adolf Hitler">committed suicide</a> less than two days later on 30 April 1945 and their corpses were burned.
Hitler's father, <a href="/wiki/Alois_Hitler" title="Alois Hitler">Alois Hitler</a>, was an <a href="/wiki/Illegitimacy" title="Illegitimacy" class="mw-redirect">illegitimate</a> child of <a href="/wiki/Maria_Schicklgruber" title="Maria Schicklgruber">Maria Anna Schicklgruber</a>. The name of Alois' father was not listed on Alois' birth certificate, and he bore his mother's surname. In 1842 <a href="/wiki/Johann_Georg_Hiedler" title="Johann Georg Hiedler">Johann Georg Hiedler</a> married Maria, and in 1876 Johann testified before a notary and three witnesses that he was the father of Alois. Despite his testimony, the question of Alois' paternity remained unresolved. For example, <a href="/wiki/Hans_Frank" title="Hans Frank">Hans Frank</a> suggested the existence of letters claiming that Alois' mother was employed as a housekeeper for a Jewish family in <a href="/wiki/Graz" title="Graz">Graz</a> and that the family's 19-year-old son, <a href="/wiki/Leopold_Frankenberger" title="Leopold Frankenberger" class="mw-redirect">Leopold Frankenberger</a>, had fathered Alois. This claim remained unsupported, however, and Frank himself did not believe that Hitler had Jewish ancestry. The suggestion that Alois' father was Jewish was also doubted by historians in the 1990s, and <a href="/wiki/Ian_Kershaw" title="Ian Kershaw">Ian Kershaw</a> dismisses the Frankenberger story as a "smear" by Hitler's adversaries. Kershaw noted that there was no evidence for a family named Frankenberger living in Graz at the time. All Jews had been expelled from Graz in the 15th century and were not allowed to return until the 1860s, well after Alois' birth.
At age 39 Alois assumed the surname Hitler, also spelled as Hiedler, Hüttler, or Huettler; the name was probably regularized to its final spelling by a clerk. The origin of the name is either "one who lives in a hut" (<a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">Standard German</a> Hütte), "shepherd" (Standard German hüten "to guard", English heed), or is from the <a href="/wiki/Slavic_languages" title="Slavic languages">Slavic</a> words Hidlar and Hidlarcek.
Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 at around 6:30&#160; pm at the Gasthof zum Pommer, an inn in Ranshofen, a village annexed in 1938 to the municipality of <a href="/wiki/Braunau_am_Inn" title="Braunau am Inn">Braunau am Inn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Upper_Austria" title="Upper Austria">Upper Austria</a>. He was the third of five children to Alois Hitler and <a href="/wiki/Klara_P%C3%B6lzl" title="Klara Pölzl" class="mw-redirect">Klara Pölzl</a>. Adolf's older siblings&#160; – Gustav and Ida&#160; – died in infancy.
At the age of three, his family moved to Kapuzinerstrasse 5 in <a href="/wiki/Passau" title="Passau">Passau</a>, Germany. There, Hitler would acquire a Bavarian dialect of <a href="/wiki/Austro-Bavarian_language" title="Austro-Bavarian language" class="mw-redirect">Austro-Bavarian</a> rather than an Austrian dialect.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>] In 1894, the family relocated to <a href="/wiki/Leonding" title="Leonding">Leonding</a> near <a href="/wiki/Linz" title="Linz">Linz</a>, and in June 1895, Alois retired to a small landholding at Hafeld near <a href="/wiki/Lambach" title="Lambach">Lambach</a>, where he tried his hand at farming and beekeeping. Adolf attended school in nearby <a href="/wiki/Fischlham" title="Fischlham">Fischlham</a>, and in his free time, he played "<a href="/wiki/Cowboys_and_Indians" title="Cowboys and Indians" class="mw-redirect">Cowboys and Indians</a>". Hitler became fixated on warfare after finding a picture book about the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a> among his father's belongings.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>].
Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. Hitler attended a Catholic school in an 11th-century <a href="/wiki/Benedictine" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> cloister, the walls of which bore engravings and crests that contained the symbol of the <a href="/wiki/Swastika" title="Swastika">swastika</a>. In Lambach the eight-year-old Hitler sang in the church choir, took singing lessons, and even entertained thoughts of one day becoming a priest. In 1898, the family returned permanently to Leonding.
On 2 February 1900 Hitler's younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Hitler" title="Edmund Hitler" class="mw-redirect">Edmund</a>, died of <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a>, deeply affecting Hitler. He changed from being confident and outgoing and an excellent student, to a morose, detached, and sullen boy who constantly fought his father and his teachers.
Hitler was attached to his mother, but he had a troubled relationship with his father, who frequently beat him, especially in the years after Alois' retirement and failed farming efforts. Alois was an Austrian customs official and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, which caused much conflict between them.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>] Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, in September 1900 his father sent Adolf to the <a href="/wiki/Realschule" title="Realschule">Realschule</a> in <a href="/wiki/Linz" title="Linz">Linz</a>, a technical high school of about 300 students. (This was the same high school that <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> would attend some 17 years later.) Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in <a href="/wiki/Mein_Kampf" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> revealed that he did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream.".
Hitler became obsessed with <a href="/wiki/Pan-Germanism" title="Pan-Germanism">German Nationalism</a> as a way to rebel against his father who proudly served the <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary" title="Austria-Hungary">Austrian Government</a>. While many <a href="/wiki/Austrians" title="Austrians">Austrians</a> —still considered themselves "<a href="/wiki/Germans" title="Germans">Germans</a>"— they remained loyal to Austria. Whereas Hitler only expressed his loyalty to <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">Germany</a>. Hitler and his friends used the German greeting "<a href="/wiki/Nazi_salute" title="Nazi salute">Heil</a>", and sang the German anthem "<a href="/wiki/Deutschland_%C3%9Cber_Alles" title="Deutschland Über Alles" class="mw-redirect">Deutschland Über Alles</a>" instead of the.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>].
After Alois' sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's behaviour at the technical school became even more disruptive, and he was asked to leave in 1904. He enrolled at the Realschule in <a href="/wiki/Steyr" title="Steyr">Steyr</a> in September 1904, but upon completing his second year, he and his friends went out for a night of celebration and drinking. While drunk, Hitler tore up his school certificate and used the pieces as toilet paper. The stained certificate was brought to the attention of the school's principal, who "... gave him such a dressing-down that the boy was reduced to shivering jelly. It was probably the most painful and humiliating experience of his life." Hitler was expelled, never to return to school again.
At age15, Hitler took part in his <a href="/wiki/First_Communion" title="First Communion">First Communion</a> on <a href="/wiki/Pentecost" title="Pentecost">Whitsunday</a>, 22 May 1904, at the Linz Cathedral. His sponsor was Emanuel Lugert, a friend of his late father.
From 1905, Hitler lived a <a href="/wiki/Bohemianism" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> life in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> with financial support from orphan's benefits and his mother. He was rejected twice by the <a href="/wiki/Academy_of_Fine_Arts_Vienna" title="Academy of Fine Arts Vienna">Academy of Fine Arts Vienna</a> (1907–1908), because of his "unfitness for painting", and was recommended to study architecture. However, he lacked the academic credentials required for architecture school:.
In a few days I myself knew that I should some day become an architect. To be sure, it was an incredibly hard road; for the studies I had neglected out of spite at the Realschule were sorely needed. One could not attend the Academy's architectural school without having attended the building school at the Technik, and the latter required a high-school degree. I had none of all this. The fulfillment of my artistic dream seemed physically impossible.
On 21 December 1907, Hitler's mother died of <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> at age 47; Hitler was devastated, and carried the grief from her death with him for the rest of his life. Ordered by a court in Linz, Hitler gave his share of the orphan's benefits to his sister <a href="/wiki/Paula_Hitler" title="Paula Hitler">Paula</a>, and at the age of 21, he inherited money from an aunt. He struggled as a painter in Vienna, copying scenes from postcards and selling his paintings to merchants and tourists. After being rejected a second time by the Academy of Arts, Hitler ran out of money. In 1909, he lived in a shelter for the homeless, and by 1910, he had settled into a <a href="/wiki/Meldemannstra%C3%9Fe_dormitory" title="Meldemannstraße dormitory">house for poor working men on Meldemannstraße</a>. Another resident of the shelter, <a href="/wiki/Reinhold_Hanisch" title="Reinhold Hanisch">Reinhold Hanisch</a>, sold Hitler's paintings, until the two men had a bitter falling-out.
Hitler stated that he first became an <a href="/wiki/Antisemite" title="Antisemite" class="mw-redirect">antisemite</a> in Vienna, which had a large Jewish community, including <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a> who had fled the <a href="/wiki/Pogrom" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> in <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Hitler's account has been questioned by his childhood friend, <a href="/wiki/August_Kubizek" title="August Kubizek">August Kubizek</a>, who suggested that Hitler was already a "confirmed antisemite" before he left Linz for Vienna. This prompted <a href="/wiki/Brigitte_Hamann" title="Brigitte Hamann">Brigitte Hamann</a> to write that "of all those early witnesses who can be taken seriously Kubizek is the only one to portray young Hitler as an anti-Semite and precisely in this respect he is not trustworthy." Vienna at the time of Hitler's residence was a hotbed of traditional religious prejudice and 19th-century racism. Hitler may have been influenced by the occult writings of the antisemite <a href="/wiki/Lanz_von_Liebenfels" title="Lanz von Liebenfels" class="mw-redirect">Lanz von Liebenfels</a> in his magazine Ostara; he probably read the publication, although it is uncertain to what degree he was influenced by von Liebenfels' writings.
There were few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries their outward appearance had become <a href="/wiki/Europeanisation" title="Europeanisation">Europeanised</a> and had taken on a human look; in fact, I even took them for Germans. The absurdity of this idea did not dawn on me because I saw no distinguishing feature but the strange religion. The fact that they had, as I believed, been persecuted on this account sometimes almost turned my distaste at unfavorable remarks about them into horror. Thus far I did not so much as suspect the existence of an organized opposition to the Jews. Then I came to Vienna. Once, as I was strolling through the Inner City, I suddenly encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks. Is this a Jew? was my first thought. For, to be sure, they had not looked like that in Linz. I observed the man furtively and cautiously, but the longer I stared at this foreign face, scrutinizing feature for feature, the more my first question assumed a new form: Is this a German?.
<a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s <a href="/wiki/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies" title="On the Jews and Their Lies">On the Jews and Their Lies</a> may have also shaped Hitler's views. In Mein Kampf, he refers to Martin Luther as a great warrior, a true statesman, and a great reformer, alongside <a href="/wiki/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frederick_the_Great" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a>. <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6pke" title="Wilhelm Röpke">Wilhelm Röpke</a> concluded that "without any question, <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> influenced the political, spiritual and social history of Germany in a way that, after careful consideration of everything, can be described only as fateful.".
At the time, Hitler apparently did not act on his views. He was a frequent dinner guest in a wealthy Jewish house, and he interacted well with Jewish merchants who tried to sell his paintings.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>].
Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to <a href="/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>. He wrote in Mein Kampf that he had always longed to live in a "real" German city. In Munich, he further pursued his interest in architecture and studied the political writings of <a href="/wiki/Houston_Stewart_Chamberlain" title="Houston Stewart Chamberlain">Houston Stewart Chamberlain</a>. Moving to Munich helped Hitler avoid <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">military service</a> in Austria, but the Munich police—in cooperation with the Austrian authorities—eventually arrested him for dodging the draft. After a physical exam and a contrite plea, he was deemed unfit for service and allowed to return to Munich. When Germany entered World War I in August 1914, he successfully petitioned King <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_III_of_Bavaria" title="Ludwig III of Bavaria">Ludwig III of Bavaria</a> for permission to serve in a <a href="/wiki/Bavaria" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> regiment, and enlisted in the Bavarian army.
Hitler served as a <a href="/wiki/Runner_(soldier)" title="Runner (soldier)">runner</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="Western Front (World War I)">Western Front</a> in France and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> in the <a href="/wiki/6th_Bavarian_Reserve_Division_(German_Empire)" title="6th Bavarian Reserve Division (German Empire)">Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16</a>. He experienced major combat, including the <a href="/wiki/First_Battle_of_Ypres" title="First Battle of Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme" title="Battle of the Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Arras_(1917)" title="Battle of Arras (1917)">Battle of Arras</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Passchendaele" title="Battle of Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>.
Hitler was twice decorated for bravery, receiving the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Cross" title="Iron Cross">Iron Cross</a>, Second Class, in 1914 and Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918. He also received the <a href="/wiki/Wound_Badge" title="Wound Badge">Wound Badge</a>. Hitler's First Class Iron Cross was recommended by <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Gutmann" title="Hugo Gutmann">Hugo Gutmann</a>, and although the latter decoration was rarely awarded to a <a href="/wiki/Gefreiter" title="Gefreiter">Gefreiter</a>, it may be explained by Hitler's post at regimental headquarters, where he had more frequent interactions with senior officers than other soldiers of similar rank. The regimental staff, however, thought Hitler lacked leadership skills, and he was never promoted.
While serving at regimental headquarters Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. In October 1916 he was wounded either in the groin area or the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme" title="Battle of the Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. Hitler spent almost two months in the Red Cross hospital at <a href="/wiki/Beelitz" title="Beelitz">Beelitz</a>. He returned to his regiment on 5 March 1917.
On 15 October 1918 Hitler and several comrades were temporarily blinded by a <a href="/wiki/Mustard_gas" title="Mustard gas" class="mw-redirect">mustard gas</a> attack. It has been suggested that he may have suffered from <a href="/wiki/Conversion_disorder" title="Conversion disorder">conversion disorder</a>, then known as "<a href="/wiki/Hysteria" title="Hysteria">hysteria</a>".[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>] He was hospitalized in Pasewalk. Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. It was during this time that Hitler's ideological development began to firmly take shape. Some scholars, notably <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Dawidowicz" title="Lucy Dawidowicz">Lucy Dawidowicz</a>, argue that Hitler's intention to exterminate Europe's Jews was fully formed at this time.[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>].
Hitler described the war as "the greatest of all experiences" and he was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery. The experience made Hitler a passionate German patriot, and he was shocked by Germany's <a href="/wiki/Capitulation_(surrender)" title="Capitulation (surrender)">capitulation</a> in November 1918. Like many other German nationalists, Hitler believed in the Dolchstoßlegende (<a href="/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_legend" title="Stab-in-the-back legend">Stab-in-the-back legend</a>), which claimed that the army, "undefeated in the field, " had been "stabbed in the back" on the <a href="/wiki/Home_front" title="Home front">home front</a> by civilian leaders and <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxists</a>, later dubbed the November Criminals.
The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and <a href="/wiki/Demilitarization" title="Demilitarization" class="mw-redirect">demilitarise</a> the <a href="/wiki/Rhineland" title="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied reparations on the country. Many Germans perceived the treaty—especially Article 231, which declared Germany responsible for the war—as a humiliation. The economic, social, and political conditions effected in Germany were later exploited by Hitler.
After World War I, Hitler remained in the army and returned to Munich, where he attended the funeral march for the murdered Bavarian prime minister <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Eisner" title="Kurt Eisner">Kurt Eisner</a>. After the suppression of the <a href="/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic" title="Bavarian Soviet Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a>, he took part in "national thinking" courses organized by the Education and Propaganda Department of the Bavarian <a href="/wiki/Reichswehr" title="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a> under Captain <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mayr" title="Karl Mayr">Karl Mayr</a>.
In July 1919 Hitler was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr, both to influence other soldiers and to <a href="/wiki/Espionage" title="Espionage">infiltrate</a> the <a href="/wiki/German_Workers%27_Party" title="German Workers' Party">German Workers' Party</a> (DAP). While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with founder <a href="/wiki/Anton_Drexler" title="Anton Drexler">Anton Drexler</a>'s antisemitic, nationalist, <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> and anti-Marxist ideas. Drexler favoured a strong active government, a "non-Jewish" version of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, and solidarity among all members of society. Drexler was impressed with Hitler's oratory skills and invited him to join the DAP. Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919, becoming the party's 55th member.
At the DAP, Hitler met <a href="/wiki/Dietrich_Eckart" title="Dietrich Eckart">Dietrich Eckart</a>, one of its early founders and a member of the occult <a href="/wiki/Thule_Society" title="Thule Society">Thule Society</a>. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing Hitler to a wide range of people in Munich society. Hitler thanked Eckart and paid tribute to him in the second volume of Mein Kampf. To increase the party's appeal, the party changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (<a href="/wiki/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party" title="National Socialist German Workers Party" class="mw-redirect">National Socialist German Workers Party</a> – NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a <a href="/wiki/Swastika" title="Swastika">swastika</a> in a white circle on a red background.
Hitler was discharged from the army in March 1920, and he began working full time for the party. By early 1921 Hitler had become highly effective at speaking to large audiences. In February 1921 Hitler spoke to a crowd of over six thousand in Munich. To publicize the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around town waving swastika flags and throwing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy, <a href="/wiki/Polemic" title="Polemic">polemic</a> speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews. At the time, the NSDAP was centred in Munich, a major hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>.
In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the DAP in Munich. Members of the DAP's executive committee, some of whom considered Hitler to be too overbearing, wanted to merge with the rival <a href="/wiki/German_Socialist_Party" title="German Socialist Party">German Socialist Party</a> (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July 1921 and angrily tendered his resignation from the DAP. The committee members then realized that Hitler's resignation would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed to his demands; Hitler rejoined the party as member 3, 680. Hitler still faced some opposition within the DAP: <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Esser" title="Hermann Esser">Hermann Esser</a> and his allies printed 3, 000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself to thunderous applause. Hitler's strategy proved successful: at a general DAP membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast.
Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Hess" title="Rudolf Hess">Rudolf Hess</a>, the former air force pilot <a href="/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring" title="Hermann Göring">Hermann Göring</a>, and the army captain <a href="/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm" title="Ernst Röhm">Ernst Röhm</a>. The latter became head of the Nazis' paramilitary organization, the <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a> (SA, "Storm Division"), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents. A critical influence on his thinking during this period was the <a href="/wiki/Aufbau_Vereinigung" title="Aufbau Vereinigung">Aufbau Vereinigung</a>, [<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from October 2011">page&#160; needed</span></a>] a conspiratorial group formed of <a href="/wiki/White_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9" title="White émigré">White Russian</a> exiles and early National Socialists. The group, financed with funds channeled from wealthy industrialists like <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, introduced him to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with <a href="/wiki/Bolshevism" title="Bolshevism" class="mw-redirect">Bolshevism</a>. Hitler attracted the attention of local business interests. He was accepted into influential circles of Munich society and became associated with wartime General <a href="/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a>.
Encouraged by his new support, Hitler recruited Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "<a href="/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch" title="Beer Hall Putsch">Beer Hall <i>Putsch</i></a>" (also known as the "Hitler Putsch" or "Munich Putsch"). The Nazi Party had used Italy's fascists as an example for its appearance and policies, and in 1923, Hitler wanted to emulate <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/March_on_Rome" title="March on Rome">March on Rome</a>" by staging his own "Campaign in Berlin". Hitler and Ludendorff sought support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) <a href="/wiki/Gustav_von_Kahr" title="Gustav von Kahr" class="mw-redirect">Gustav von Kahr</a>, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr along with Police Chief <a href="/wiki/Hans_Ritter_von_Seisser" title="Hans Ritter von Seisser">Hans Ritter von Seisser</a> (Seißer) and Reichswehr General <a href="/wiki/Otto_von_Lossow" title="Otto von Lossow">Otto von Lossow</a> wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.
Hitler wanted to seize a critical moment for successful popular agitation and support. So on 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3, 000 people, organized by Kahr in the <a href="/wiki/B%C3%BCrgerbr%C3%A4ukeller" title="Bürgerbräukeller">Bürgerbräukeller</a>, a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler interrupted Kahr's speech and announced that the national revolution had begun, declaring the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. With his hand gun drawn, Hitler demanded the support of Kahr, Seisser and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded at occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters; however, neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler. Kahr and his consorts quickly withdrew their support and fled to join the opposition to Hitler. The following day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_War_(Kingdom_of_Bavaria)" title="Ministry of War (Kingdom of Bavaria)">Bavarian War Ministry</a> to overthrow the Bavarian government on their "March on Berlin", but the police dispersed them. and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.
Hitler fled to the home of <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Hanfstaengl" title="Ernst Hanfstaengl">Ernst Hanfstaengl</a>, and by some accounts contemplated suicide, but this state of mind has been disputed by others. Hitler was depressed but calm when he was found and arrested by the police on 11 November 1923. He was tried for <a href="/wiki/High_treason" title="High treason">high treason</a> before the special <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Bavaria)" title="People's Court (Bavaria)">People's Court</a> in Munich, and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Rosenberg" title="Alfred Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a> became temporary leader of the NSDAP. During his trial, Hitler was given almost unlimited time to speak, and his popularity soared as he voiced nationalistic sentiments in his defence speech. His trial began on 26 February 1924 and on 1 April 1924 Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at <a href="/wiki/Landsberg_Prison" title="Landsberg Prison">Landsberg Prison</a>. Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards and received a lot of mail from supporters. The Bavarian Supreme Court soon issued a pardon and he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler had been imprisoned for just over one year for the attempted coup.
