She first stood for Parliament in the <a href="/wiki/South_West_Surrey_by-election, _1984" title="South West Surrey by-election, 1984">1984 Surrey South-West by-election</a>, before standing in Hornsey and Wood Green in 1987. First elected to Parliament in 1992, she saw her majority soar to 20, 500 in 1997 (including polling 26, 000 votes more than <a href="/wiki/Lynne_Featherstone" title="Lynne Featherstone">the Lib Dem candidate</a> who eventually unseated her). However, by 2001 her majority had almost halved to 10, 500, and in 2005 she unexpectedly lost her seat on a large 14.6% swing. Factors in her defeat include her association with many of the government's more unpopular policies, such as the crucial 26 March 2003 vote on the war on Iraq, with The Times describing her in 2005 as "a fiercely loyal Labour MP, who has only rebelled against the Government in four out of 1570 votes.".
