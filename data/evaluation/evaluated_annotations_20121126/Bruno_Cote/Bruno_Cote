Bruno Côté (August 10, 1940 – June 30, 2010) was a contemporary Canadian landscape painter.
Bruno Côté was born in Quebec City in August 1940. His youth in a family where art held a strong significance encouraged the development of his artistic talents. He joined the family's publicity business in 1957. In 1978 he moved to Baie-Saint-Paul, where he held his first important solo exhibition. In 1980 he began to travel, painting landscapes in many different regions of Canada. Bruno Côté is represented by art galleries across Canada. In 2008 the Canadian Parliament gave Côté's painting, The Portage Trail to the Parliament of Scotland to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament Building.
Côté died on June 30, 2010 in Baie-Saint-Paul, after prostate cancer had metastasized.
