Charles Édouard Guillaume (15 February 1861, <a href="/wiki/Fleurier" title="Fleurier">Fleurier</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> – 13 May 1938, <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A8vres" title="Sèvres">Sèvres</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>) was a Swiss physicist who received the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys.
Guillaume is known for his discovery of nickel-steel alloys he named <a href="/wiki/Invar" title="Invar">invar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elinvar" title="Elinvar">elinvar</a>. Invar has a near-zero <a href="/wiki/Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion" title="Coefficient of thermal expansion" class="mw-redirect">coefficient of thermal expansion</a>, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the <a href="/wiki/Modulus_of_elasticity" title="Modulus of elasticity" class="mw-redirect">modulus of elasticity</a>, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the <a href="/wiki/Marine_chronometer" title="Marine chronometer">marine chronometer</a>. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for <a href="/wiki/Antimagnetic_watch" title="Antimagnetic watch">antimagnetic watches</a>.
As the son of a Swiss <a href="/wiki/Horologist" title="Horologist" class="mw-redirect">horologist</a> Guillaume took an interest in marine chronometers. For use as the <a href="/wiki/Compensation_balance" title="Compensation balance" class="mw-redirect">compensation balance</a> he developed a slight variation of the invar alloy which had a negative quadratic coefficient of expansion. The purpose of doing this was to eliminate the "middle temperature" error of the balance wheel.
Guillaume was head of the <a href="/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures" title="International Bureau of Weights and Measures">International Bureau of Weights and Measures</a>. He worked with <a href="/wiki/Kristian_Birkeland" title="Kristian Birkeland">Kristian Birkeland</a>, serving at the <a href="/wiki/Observatoire_de_Paris" title="Observatoire de Paris" class="mw-redirect">Observatoire de Paris</a>—Section de Meudon. He conducted several <a href="/wiki/Experiment" title="Experiment">experiments</a> with <a href="/wiki/Thermostatic" title="Thermostatic">thermostatic</a> measurements at the <a href="/wiki/Observatory" title="Observatory">observatory</a>. He was the first to determine accurately the temperature of space.
Guillaume was married in 1888 to A.M. Taufflieb, with whom he had three children.
