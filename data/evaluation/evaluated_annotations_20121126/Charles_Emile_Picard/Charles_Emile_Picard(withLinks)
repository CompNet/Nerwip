Charles Émile Picard <a href="/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="Fellow of the Royal Society" class="mw-redirect">FRS</a> (French pronunciation:&#160; ; 24 July 1856 – 11 December 1941) was a French <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a>. He was elected the fifteenth member to occupy seat 1 of the <a href="/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise" title="Académie Française" class="mw-redirect">Académie Française</a> in 1924. .

Picard's mathematical papers, textbooks, and many popular writings exhibit an extraordinary range of interests, as well as an impressive mastery of the mathematics of his time. Modern students of <a href="/wiki/Complex_variables" title="Complex variables">complex variables</a> are probably familiar with two of his named theorems. His lesser theorem states that every nonconstant <a href="/wiki/Entire_function" title="Entire function">entire function</a> takes every value in the <a href="/wiki/Complex_plane" title="Complex plane">complex plane</a>, with perhaps one exception. His greater theorem states that an <a href="/wiki/Analytic_function" title="Analytic function">analytic function</a> with an <a href="/wiki/Essential_singularity" title="Essential singularity">essential singularity</a> takes every value infinitely often, with perhaps one exception, in any neighborhood of the singularity. He also made important contributions in the theory of <a href="/wiki/Differential_equation" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a>, including work on <a href="/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Vessiot_theory" title="Picard–Vessiot theory">Picard–Vessiot theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Painlev%C3%A9_transcendents" title="Painlevé transcendents">Painlevé transcendents</a> and his introduction of a kind of <a href="/wiki/Symmetry_group" title="Symmetry group">symmetry group</a> for a <a href="/wiki/Linear_differential_equation" title="Linear differential equation">linear differential equation</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Picard_group" title="Picard group">Picard group</a>. In connection with his work on function theory, he was one of the first mathematicians to use the emerging ideas of <a href="/wiki/Algebraic_topology" title="Algebraic topology">algebraic topology</a>. In addition to his path-breaking theoretical work, Picard also made important contributions to <a href="/wiki/Applied_mathematics" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a>, including the theories of telegraphy and elasticity. His collected papers run to four volumes.
Like his contemporary, <a href="/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a>, Picard was much concerned with the training of mathematics, physics, and engineering students. He wrote a classic textbook on <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_analysis" title="Mathematical analysis">analysis</a> and one of the first textbooks on the <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a>. Picard's popular writings include biographies of many leading French mathematicians, including his father in law, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hermite" title="Charles Hermite">Charles Hermite</a>.
