Charles Hermite (French pronunciation:&#160; ) (December 24, 1822 – January 14, 1901) was a <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> who did research on <a href="/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quadratic_form" title="Quadratic form">quadratic forms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Invariant_theory" title="Invariant theory">invariant theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials" title="Orthogonal polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_function" title="Elliptic function">elliptic functions</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Algebra" title="Algebra">algebra</a>.
<a href="/wiki/Hermite_polynomials" title="Hermite polynomials">Hermite polynomials</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermite_interpolation" title="Hermite interpolation">Hermite interpolation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermite_normal_form" title="Hermite normal form">Hermite normal form</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermitian_operator" title="Hermitian operator" class="mw-redirect">Hermitian operators</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline" title="Cubic Hermite spline">cubic Hermite splines</a> are named in his honor. One of his students was <a href="/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a>.
He was the first to prove that <a href="/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)" title="E (mathematical constant)"><i>e</i></a>, the base of <a href="/wiki/Natural_logarithm" title="Natural logarithm">natural logarithms</a>, is a <a href="/wiki/Transcendental_number" title="Transcendental number">transcendental number</a>. His methods were later used by <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Lindemann" title="Ferdinand von Lindemann">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a> to prove that <a href="/wiki/Pi" title="Pi">π</a> is transcendental.
In a letter to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Joannes_Stieltjes" title="Thomas Joannes Stieltjes">Thomas Stieltjes</a> in 1893, Hermite famously remarked: "I turn with terror and horror from this lamentable scourge of <a href="/wiki/Weierstrass_function" title="Weierstrass function">continuous functions with no derivatives</a>.".
Born at <a href="/wiki/Dieuze" title="Dieuze">Dieuze</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moselle" title="Moselle">Moselle</a>, 24 December, 1822 he was the son of a salt mine engineer, Ferdinand Hermite. His mother was Madeleine Lallemand. The family moved to run a drapers business in Nancy in 1828 and his father also pursued ambitions as an artist. Charles was the sixth of his parents' seven children.
Charles had a defect in his right foot which meant that from boyhood he moved around with difficulty.
He studied at the <a href="/wiki/Nancy-Universit%C3%A9" title="Nancy-Université">Collège de Nancy</a> and then, in Paris, at the <a href="/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_Henri_IV" title="Collège Henri IV" class="mw-redirect">Collège Henri IV</a> and at the <a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand" title="Lycée Louis-le-Grand">Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a>.
Hermite wanted to study at the École Polytechnique and he took a year preparing for the examinations and was tutored by <a href="/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan" title="Eugène Charles Catalan">Catalan</a> between 1841 and 1842.
In 1842 he entered the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique" title="École Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>, where he remained as a student for a short time. After one year at the École Polytechnique Hermite was refused the right to continue his studies because of his disability (Ecole Polytechnique is to this day a military academy). He had to fight to regain his place which he won but with strict conditions imposed. Hermite found this unacceptable and decided to leave the École Polytechnique without graduating.
As a boy he read some of the writings of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange" title="Joseph Louis Lagrange">Joseph Louis Lagrange</a> on the solution of numerical equations, and of <a href="/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="Carl Friedrich Gauss">Carl Gauss</a> on the theory of numbers. In 1842, his first original contribution to mathematics, in which he gave a simple proof of the proposition of <a href="/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel" title="Niels Henrik Abel">Niels Abel</a> concerning the impossibility of obtaining an algebraic solution for the equation of the fifth degree, was published in the "Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques".
A correspondence with <a href="/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi" title="Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi">Carl Jacobi</a>, begun in 1843 and continued in 1844, led to the insertion, in the complete edition of Jacobi's works, of two articles by Hermite, one concerning the extension to <a href="/wiki/Abelian_variety" title="Abelian variety">Abelian functions</a> of one of the theorems of Abel on <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_functions" title="Elliptic functions" class="mw-redirect">elliptic functions</a>, and the other concerning the transformation of elliptic functions.
After spending five years working privately towards his degree, in which he befriended eminent mathematicians <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Bertrand" title="Joseph Bertrand" class="mw-redirect">Joseph Bertrand</a>, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Liouville" title="Joseph Liouville">Joseph Liouville</a>, he took and passed the examinations for the <a href="/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at" title="Baccalauréat">baccalauréat</a>, which he was awarded in 1847. He married Joseph Bertrand's sister, Louise Bertrand in 1848.
In 1848, Hermite returned to the École Polytechnique as répétiteur and examinateur d'admission. In 1856 he contracted smallpox. Through the influence of <a href="/wiki/Augustin_Louis_Cauchy" title="Augustin Louis Cauchy" class="mw-redirect">Augustin Cauchy</a> and of a nun who nursed him, he resumed the practice of his religion. On 14 July, of that year, he was elected to fill the vacancy created by the death of <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Philippe_Marie_Binet" title="Jacques Philippe Marie Binet">Jacques Binet</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences" title="Académie des Sciences" class="mw-redirect">Académie des Sciences</a>. In 1869, he succeeded <a href="/wiki/Jean-Marie_Duhamel" title="Jean-Marie Duhamel">Jean-Marie Duhamel</a> as professor of mathematics, both at the École Polytechnique, where he remained until 1876, and in the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, which was a post he occupied until his death. From 1862 to 1873 he was lecturer at the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure" title="École Normale Supérieure">École Normale Supérieure</a>. Upon his seventieth birthday, on the occasion of his jubilee which was celebrated at the Sorbonne under the auspices of an international committee, he was promoted grand officer of the <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur" title="Légion d'honneur" class="mw-redirect">Légion d'honneur</a>.
He died in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, 14 January, 1901, aged 78.
As a teacher Hermite was inspiring. His correspondence with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Joannes_Stieltjes" title="Thomas Joannes Stieltjes">Thomas Stieltjes</a> testifies to the great aid he gave those entering scientific life. His efforts in teaching were directed not towards too rigorous minuteness, but towards exciting admiration for things simple and beautiful. His published courses of lectures have exercised a wide influence. His important original contributions to <a href="/wiki/Pure_mathematics" title="Pure mathematics">pure mathematics</a>, published in the leading mathematical journals of the world, dealt chiefly with <a href="/wiki/Abelian_function" title="Abelian function" class="mw-redirect">Abelian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_function" title="Elliptic function">elliptic functions</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">theory of numbers</a>. In 1858 he solved the equation of the fifth degree by elliptic functions; and in 1873 he proved <a href="/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)" title="E (mathematical constant)"><i>e</i></a>, the base of the <a href="/wiki/Natural_logarithm" title="Natural logarithm">natural system of logarithms</a>, to be <a href="/wiki/Transcendental_number" title="Transcendental number">transcendental</a>. This last was used by <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Lindemann" title="Ferdinand von Lindemann">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a> to prove in 1882 the same for <a href="/wiki/Pi" title="Pi">π</a>.
The following is a list of his works.
