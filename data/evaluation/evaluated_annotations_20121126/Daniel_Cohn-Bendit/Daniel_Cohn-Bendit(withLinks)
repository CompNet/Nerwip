Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit (born 4 April 1945) is a <a href="/wiki/German_nationality" title="German nationality" class="mw-redirect">German</a> politician, active in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. He was a student leader during the unrest of <a href="/wiki/May_1968_in_France" title="May 1968 in France">May 1968 in France</a> and he was also known during that time as Dany le Rouge (French for "Danny the Red", because of both his politics and the color of his hair). He is currently co-president of the group <a href="/wiki/European_Greens%E2%80%93European_Free_Alliance" title="European Greens–European Free Alliance" class="mw-redirect">European Greens–European Free Alliance</a> in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, becoming "Dany le Vert" (French for "Danny the Green", because of his new fight for ecology).
In 2010, he was involved in founding <a href="/wiki/JCall" title="JCall">JCall</a>, advocacy group based in Europe to lobby the <a href="/wiki/European_parliament" title="European parliament" class="mw-redirect">European parliament</a> on foreign policy issues concerning the Middle East.
Cohn-Bendit was born in <a href="/wiki/Montauban" title="Montauban">Montauban</a>, France, to a <a href="/wiki/Yekke" title="Yekke">German-Jewish</a> father and a French-Jewish mother who had fled <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> in 1933. He spent his childhood in <a href="/wiki/Montauban" title="Montauban">Montauban</a>. He moved to Germany in 1958, where his father had been a lawyer since the end of the war. He attended the Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim near <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, a secondary school for children of the upper middle class. Being officially <a href="/wiki/Stateless" title="Stateless">stateless</a> at birth, when he reached the age of 14 he chose German citizenship, in order to avoid <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">conscription</a>.
He returned to France in 1966 to study sociology at the <a href="/wiki/Paris_X_University_Nanterre" title="Paris X University Nanterre" class="mw-redirect">University of Nanterre</a> under the supervision of the <a href="/wiki/Network_society" title="Network society">network society</a>'s theorist <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Castells" title="Manuel Castells">Manuel Castells</a>. He soon joined the larger and classic nationwide <a href="/wiki/Anarchist" title="Anarchist" class="mw-redirect">anarchist</a> federation Fédération anarchiste, which he left in 1967 in favour of the smaller and local Groupe anarchiste de Nanterre and the Noir et rouge magazine. Although residing in Paris, he was frequently able to travel back to Germany, where he was notably influenced by the death of <a href="/wiki/Benno_Ohnesorg" title="Benno Ohnesorg">Benno Ohnesorg</a> in 1967, and the assault on <a href="/wiki/Rudi_Dutschke" title="Rudi Dutschke">Rudi Dutschke</a> in April 1968. In this tense context, he invited Karl Dietrich Wolff, leader of the <a href="/wiki/Sozialistischer_Deutscher_Studentenbund" title="Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund">Socialist German Student Union</a>, for a lecture in Paris, which would prove influential to later May events.
In Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was a leader in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as participating in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed to attracting to him a lot of student supporters later to be called the '<a href="/wiki/Movement_of_22_March" title="Movement of 22 March">22 March Movement</a>', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist semantics. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968 students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris.
From <a href="/wiki/May_1968_in_France" title="May 1968 in France">3 May 1968 onwards</a>, massive student and workers riots erupted in Paris against <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>'s government. Cohn-Bendit quickly emerged as a public face of the student protests, along with Jacques Sauvageot, Alain Geismar and <a href="/wiki/Alain_Krivine" title="Alain Krivine">Alain Krivine</a>. His "foreign" origins were highlighted by opponents of the student movement, leading to students taking up the chant, "Nous sommes tous des Juifs allemands" ("We are all German Jews").
The <a href="/wiki/French_Communist_Party" title="French Communist Party">French Communist Party</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Georges_Marchais" title="Georges Marchais">Georges Marchais</a> described Cohn-Bendit as the "German anarchist Cohn-Bendit" and denounced some student protesters as "sons of the upper bourgeoisie... who will quickly forget their revolutionary flame in order to manage daddy's firm and exploit workers there". Continued police violence, however, prompted trade unions (and eventually the Communist Party) to support the students, and from 13 May onwards, France was struck by a general strike.
However Cohn-Bendit had already retreated on 10 May with a few friends to the Atlantic coast city of <a href="/wiki/Saint-Nazaire" title="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>, seeing that his Nanterre group had become a minority without political influence in the larger Paris students' movement. Cohn-Bendit's political opponents took advantage of his German passport and had him expelled from Saint-Nazaire to Germany on 22 May as a "seditious alien". On 27 May the Communist-led workers signed the <a href="/wiki/Grenelle_agreements" title="Grenelle agreements">Grenelle agreements</a> with the government; on 30 May supporters of the president organised a successful demonstration; new elections were called and at the end of June 1968 the Gaullists were back in power, now occupying three-quarters of the French National Assembly.
On the whole, Cohn-Bendit had participated little in the May 1968 Paris events, which continued without him, but he had become a legend, which was to be used later in the 1990s upon his return to France.
In <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> in the family house, Cohn-Bendit became one of co-founders of the <a href="/wiki/Autonomist_Marxism" title="Autonomist Marxism" class="mw-redirect">autonomist</a> group Revolutionärer Kampf (Revolutionary Struggle) in <a href="/wiki/R%C3%BCsselsheim" title="Rüsselsheim">Rüsselsheim</a>. From this point his fate was linked with <a href="/wiki/Joschka_Fischer" title="Joschka Fischer">Joschka Fischer</a>, another leader in the group. Both were later to become leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Realo" title="Realo" class="mw-redirect">Realo</a> wing of the <a href="/wiki/German_Green_Party" title="German Green Party" class="mw-redirect">German Green Party</a>, alongside many former Communist and non-Communist <a href="/wiki/Left-libertarianism" title="Left-libertarianism">libertarian leftists</a>.
Some[<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" class="mw-redirect"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. from June 2011">who?</span></a>] have suggested that the group participated in violent action, which was common in the German <a href="/wiki/Extreme_left" title="Extreme left" class="mw-redirect">extreme left</a> of the early-seventies. But testimony from witnesses appears contradictory, sometimes unreliable. Communal apartments were common on the left, and peaceful political activists could easily have shared living quarters with terrorists, without further collaboration. In 2003 a request was presented by Frankfurt prosecutors to the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, requesting they waive the immunity of <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> Cohn-Bendit, in the context of a criminal investigation against the terrorist, <a href="/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Klein" title="Hans-Joachim Klein">Hans-Joachim Klein</a>, but the request was rejected by the assembly.
While Fischer was more concerned with demonstrations, Cohn-Bendit worked in the Karl-Marx-Buchhandlung bookshop and ran a. In his 1975 book Le Grand Bazar, he described himself as engaging in sexual activities with very young children at the kindergarten. In 2001 Cohn-Bendit said that the account was invented for purposes of "verbal provocation", and that “I admit that what I wrote is unacceptable nowadays”.
In the late 1970s, as many 'rebel' movements were petering out, he became editor of the Pflasterstrand, the alternative magazine which served as house organ to the anarchist-oriented Sponti-Szene in Frankfurt. There he began taking part in the environmental movement's civil agitation against nuclear energy and the expansion of the Frankfurt airport. When the Sponti movement officially accepted parliamentary democracy in 1984 he joined the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_%2790/The_Greens" title="Alliance '90/The Greens">German Green Party</a>.
In 1988 he published, in French, Nous l'avons tant aimée, la révolution (In English: We Loved It So Much, the Revolution), a book full of nostalgia for the 1968 counter-culture, and announced his shift toward more centrist policies. In 1989 he became deputy mayor of <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, in charge of multicultural affairs. Immigrants made up some 30% of the city at that time. He also developed a more tolerant policy towards drug addicts.
In 1994 he was elected to the European parliament, though he had been placed only eighth on the electoral list because of his support of military intervention in <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>, as German Greens at the time did not support the resumption of German military intervention abroad.
At the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election, _1999" title="European Parliament election, 1999">European elections in 1999</a>, he re-entered French politics as the leader of the French Green Party (<a href="/wiki/Les_Verts" title="Les Verts">Les Verts</a>) list. He found considerable support in the French media, who often feature him, even when he does not represent or is at odds with the French Green party. He reached 9.72% of votes, a score since then unequalled by the French Greens.
In 2002 he became president of the Green parliamentary group, together with the Italian MEP <a href="/wiki/Monica_Frassoni" title="Monica Frassoni">Monica Frassoni</a>.
Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s Cohn-Bendit attracted controversy for his independent views. He was criticised from the political right for being a strong proponent of freer <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, the legalisation of <a href="/wiki/Soft_drug" title="Soft drug" class="mw-redirect">soft drugs</a>, and the abandonment of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and from the left for his pro-<a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> policies, his support for military interventions in <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and frequent collaboration with centrist personalities (<a href="/wiki/Bernard_Kouchner" title="Bernard Kouchner">Bernard Kouchner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou" title="François Bayrou">François Bayrou</a> for instance).
Cohn-Bendit's disregard for conventional European politics of left and right has made him more unpopular in France than in Germany. The <a href="/wiki/French_Green_Party" title="French Green Party" class="mw-redirect">French Green Party</a> and the French left in general remain more attached to these distinctions, whereas in the <a href="/wiki/German_Green_Party" title="German Green Party" class="mw-redirect">German Green Party</a>, the moderate <a href="/wiki/Realo" title="Realo" class="mw-redirect">Realo</a> wing had already won over the hard-line <a href="/wiki/Fundi_(politics)" title="Fundi (politics)">Fundi</a> wing, possible alliances with the Conservatives were no longer taboo, and <a href="/wiki/Third_way_(centrism)" title="Third way (centrism)" class="mw-redirect">third way</a> policies under the <a href="/wiki/Center-left" title="Center-left" class="mw-redirect">center-left</a> <a href="/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der" title="Gerhard Schröder">Gerhard Schröder</a> government, such as <a href="/wiki/Agenda_2010" title="Agenda 2010">Agenda 2010</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Hartz_concept" title="Hartz concept">Hartz I - IV</a> laws, found considerable support. He was also accused of not giving to the French party the percentage of income that all <a href="/wiki/MEPs" title="MEPs" class="mw-redirect">MEPs</a> and other elected members are supposed to give to their party, although the party had officially agreed to exempt him before his first election in France. This, alongside his <a href="/wiki/Pro-European" title="Pro-European" class="mw-redirect">pro-European</a> attitude, led him to participate in the 2004 European elections on the German side, where he became the highest male candidate on the list and was elected again.
In 2009, Cohn-Bendit criticised Pope <a href="/wiki/Benedict_XVI" title="Benedict XVI" class="mw-redirect">Benedict XVI</a> over his comment that condoms only make AIDS worse.
In 2003, during the Convention that prepared the text of the <a href="/wiki/European_constitution" title="European constitution" class="mw-redirect">European constitution</a>, Cohn-Bendit singled himself out by stating that the countries who would vote No should be compelled to hold a second referendum, and in case of a second No, should be expelled from the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>.
In February 2004, in the context of the preparation of his electoral campaign and in the wider context of the final governmental drafting of the text, he led the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/European_Green_Party" title="European Green Party">European Green Party</a> in Rome. Fischer had directly participated to the drafting as German minister of foreign affairs, he was considered one of the candidates for the new role of "European minister of Foreign Affairs" evoked in the text, and his speech was the keynote of the event. Cohn-Bendit described the European Green Party as the first stone of European citizenship, but other commentators described this new structure as a mere adaptation of the former <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_European_Green_Parties" title="Federation of European Green Parties" class="mw-redirect">Federation of European Green Parties</a>. Just as in the former structure, only delegates from national parties were allowed to vote, individual supporters were only entitled to receive information, and all other federations of European parties had to adapt their statuses later in 2004 to the new regulations from the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> about <a href="/wiki/European_political_party" title="European political party">European political parties</a>, in order to continue receive public funding. However, Cohn-Bendit as usual was early and energetic in presenting this innovation to the media.
During this congress in Rome he also confirmed his involvement in favour of <a href="/wiki/Free_software" title="Free software">free software</a>. He publicly confessed not understanding much about computer terms, but supported <a href="/wiki/License-free_software" title="License-free software">license-free software</a> as part of a stronger market economy.
In 2005 he took an active part in the campaign in favour of the <a href="/wiki/European_constitution" title="European constitution" class="mw-redirect">European constitution</a> during the French referendum. The treaty was considered by a large part of the left as a European version of <a href="/wiki/Globalisation" title="Globalisation" class="mw-redirect">globalisation</a>, and Cohn-Bendit became loathed by treaty opponents as one of the symbols of centre-left leaders collaborating with <a href="/wiki/Neo-liberalism" title="Neo-liberalism" class="mw-redirect">neo-liberalism</a> through international institutions, along with <a href="/wiki/Pascal_Lamy" title="Pascal Lamy">Pascal Lamy</a> from the <a href="/wiki/French_Socialist_Party" title="French Socialist Party" class="mw-redirect">Socialist Party</a>. He also singled himself out by appearing publicly with right-wing leaders, contrarily to the tactics adopted by the <a href="/wiki/Les_Verts" title="Les Verts">Green Party</a> and the centre-left during that campaign.
On 7 June 2009, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election, _2009" title="European Parliament election, 2009">European Parliament elections</a> gave Cohn-Bendit a major breakthrough in France. In spite of a conservative victory by Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP Party with 27, 9% of the votes and an overall conservative victory all over Europe, Europe Écologie, the coalition founded by Cohn-Bendit, won over 16, 28% of the votes, trailing the French Socialist Party led by Martine Aubry (16, 48%) by only 0, 2%. According to official French results, Cohn-Bendit's list thus became the third political force in France, even overtaking the Socialist Party in the Paris region, and, furthermore by adding the votes of an alternative green party also present in the election, giving greens a never yet experienced weight in French politics. His list featured Franco-Norwegian Magistrate <a href="/wiki/Eva_Joly" title="Eva Joly">Eva Joly</a>, a specialist of anti-corruption struggles, and <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bov%C3%A9" title="José Bové">José Bové</a>, a controversial unionist.
On 15 September 2010 Daniel Cohn-Bendit supported the new initiative <a href="/wiki/Spinelli_Group" title="Spinelli Group">Spinelli Group</a>, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters are: <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Delors" title="Jacques Delors">Jacques Delors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joschka_Fischer" title="Joschka Fischer">Joschka Fischer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Duff" title="Andrew Duff">Andrew Duff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elmar_Brok" title="Elmar Brok">Elmar Brok</a>.
In December, 2008 it was reported that Cohn-Bendit had an impolite discussion with <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Klaus" title="Václav Klaus">Václav Klaus</a>, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Czech_Republic" title="President of the Czech Republic">President of the Czech Republic</a>, in a meeting held prior to the Czech presidency of the European Union. Cohn-Bendit reportedly told the Czechs not to interfere with passage of the EU's <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> package.
Cohn-Bendit, a vocal supporter of <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>'s green-urban-liberal <a href="/wiki/Politics_Can_Be_Different" title="Politics Can Be Different">LMP</a> party, had a fiery discussion with conservative Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Orb%C3%A1n" title="Viktor Orbán">Viktor Orbán</a> over a new Hungarian press freedom and media law in a January 2011 EP meeting. Cohn-Bendit stated, amongst others, that Orbán's speech took away his appetite for lunch (alluding to a lunch invitation by Orbán). As a reply, Orbán failed to shake hands with him following the meeting.
He is the co-author, with his brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, of Obsolete Communism: The Left-Wing Alternative (1968). This book combines an account of the events of May 1968 with a critique of <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, the <a href="/wiki/French_Communist_Party" title="French Communist Party">French Communist Party</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade union</a> establishment. It remains available today and has had some lasting influence on anarchist and <a href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist" class="mw-redirect">socialist</a> thought.
