He has represented the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_electoral_district" title="Canadian electoral district" class="mw-redirect">district</a> of <a href="/wiki/Conception_Bay_East_-_Bell_Island" title="Conception Bay East - Bell Island" class="mw-redirect">Conception Bay East - Bell Island</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_House_of_Assembly" title="Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly">Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly</a> since 2010.
In November 2010, Brazil won the nomination to be the <a href="/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador">Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador</a> candidate in a by-election for the electoral district of Conception Bay East - Bell Island defeating five other candidates for the nomination. The by-election was being held to replace the late <a href="/wiki/Dianne_Whalen" title="Dianne Whalen">Dianne Whalen</a> who had died a month earlier.
The by-election was called for December 2, 2010 with two other candidates running for the <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party" title="Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party" class="mw-redirect">New Democrats</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador">Liberals</a>. One week before the by-election, on November 25, <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador">Premier</a> <a href="/wiki/Danny_Williams_(politician)" title="Danny Williams (politician)">Danny Williams</a> announced that he would retire from politics on December 3, 2010. With the announcement that the Premier would be resigning it left many wondering if Brazil, who was initially thought to easily hold onto the seat for the Tories, would be able to win now that the party's popular leader was stepping down. However on December 2, 2010, Brazil defeated both the New Democratic and Liberal Party candidates, winning 66% of the popular vote. The percentage of the vote was consistent with previous by-election wins the PCs had before the announcement that Williams was retiring.
