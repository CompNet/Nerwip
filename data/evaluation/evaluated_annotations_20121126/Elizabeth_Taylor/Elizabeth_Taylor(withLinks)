From her early years as a child star with <a href="/wiki/MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a>, she became one of the great screen actresses of <a href="/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema" title="Classical Hollywood cinema">Hollywood's Golden Age</a>. As one of the world's most famous film stars, Taylor was recognized for her acting ability and for her glamorous lifestyle, beauty and distinctive violet eyes.
<a href="/wiki/National_Velvet_(film)" title="National Velvet (film)">National Velvet</a> (1944) was Taylor's first success, and she starred in <a href="/wiki/Father_of_the_Bride_(1950_film)" title="Father of the Bride (1950 film)">Father of the Bride</a> (1950), <a href="/wiki/A_Place_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="A Place in the Sun (film)">A Place in the Sun</a> (1951), <a href="/wiki/Giant_(1956_film)" title="Giant (1956 film)">Giant</a> (1956), <a href="/wiki/Cat_on_a_Hot_Tin_Roof" title="Cat on a Hot Tin Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a> (1958), and <a href="/wiki/Suddenly, _Last_Summer_(film)" title="Suddenly, Last Summer (film)">Suddenly, Last Summer</a> (1959).

(film)">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a> (1966), for which Taylor won a second Academy Award. From the mid-1970s, she appeared less frequently in film, and made occasional appearances in television and theatre.
Her much publicized personal life included eight marriages and several life-threatening illnesses. From the mid-1980s, Taylor championed HIV and AIDS programs; she co-founded the <a href="/wiki/American_Foundation_for_AIDS_Research" title="American Foundation for AIDS Research" class="mw-redirect">American Foundation for AIDS Research</a> in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1993.

Taylor died of <a href="/wiki/Heart_failure" title="Heart failure">congestive heart failure</a> at the age of 79.
Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor was born at Heathwood, her parents' home at 8 Wildwood Road in <a href="/wiki/Hampstead_Garden_Suburb" title="Hampstead Garden Suburb">Hampstead Garden Suburb</a>, a northwestern suburb of London; the younger of two children of <a href="/wiki/Francis_Lenn_Taylor" title="Francis Lenn Taylor">Francis Lenn Taylor</a> (1897–1968) and <a href="/wiki/Sara_Sothern" title="Sara Sothern">Sara Viola Warmbrodt</a> (1895–1994), who were <a href="/wiki/People_of_the_United_States" title="People of the United States" class="mw-redirect">Americans</a> residing in England. Taylor's older brother, Howard Taylor, was born in 1929. Her parents were originally from <a href="/wiki/Arkansas_City, _Kansas" title="Arkansas City, Kansas">Arkansas City, Kansas</a>. Francis Taylor was an art dealer, and Sara was a former actress whose stage name was "Sara Sothern". Sothern retired from the stage in 1926 when she married Francis in New York City. Taylor's two first names are in honor of her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Mary (Rosemond) Taylor.
Colonel <a href="/wiki/Victor_Cazalet" title="Victor Cazalet">Victor Cazalet</a>, one of their closest friends, had an important influence on the family. He was a rich, well-connected bachelor, a Member of Parliament and close friend of <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Cazalet loved both art and theater and was passionate when encouraging the Taylor family to think of England as their permanent home. Additionally, as a <a href="/wiki/Christian_Scientist" title="Christian Scientist" class="mw-redirect">Christian Scientist</a> and lay preacher, his links with the family were spiritual. He also became Elizabeth's godfather. In one instance, when she was suffering with a severe infection as a child, she was kept in her bed for weeks. She "begged" for his company: "Mother, please call Victor and ask him to come and sit with me.":14.
Biographer <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Walker_(critic)" title="Alexander Walker (critic)">Alexander Walker</a> suggests that Elizabeth's <a href="/wiki/Religious_conversion" title="Religious conversion">conversion</a> to Judaism at the age of 27 and her life-long support for <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>, may have been influenced by views she heard at home. Walker notes that Cazalet actively campaigned for a Jewish homeland, and her mother also worked in various charities, which included sponsoring fundraisers for <a href="/wiki/Zionism" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>. Her mother recalls the influence that Cazalet had on Elizabeth:.
A <a href="/wiki/Multiple_citizenship" title="Multiple citizenship">dual citizen</a> of the United Kingdom and the United States, she was born British, through her <a href="/wiki/Jus_soli" title="Jus soli">birth on British soil</a> and an American citizen <a href="/wiki/Jus_sanguinis" title="Jus sanguinis">through her parents</a>. She reportedly sought, in 1965, to renounce her United States citizenship, to wit: "Though never accepted by the State Department, Elizabeth renounced in 1965. Attempting to shield much of her European income from U.S. taxes, Elizabeth wished to become solely a British citizen. According to news reports at the time, officials denied her request when she failed to complete the renunciation oath, refusing to say that she renounced "all allegiance to the United States of America.".
At the age of three, Taylor began taking ballet lessons. Shortly before the beginning of World War II, her parents decided to return to the United States to avoid hostilities. Her mother took the children first, arriving in New York in April 1939, while her father remained in London to wrap up matters in his art business, arriving in November. They settled in Los Angeles, California, where her father established a new art gallery, which included many paintings he shipped from England. The gallery would soon attract numerous Hollywood celebrities who appreciated its modern European paintings. According to Walker, the gallery "opened many doors for the Taylors, leading them directly into the society of money and prestige" within Hollywood's movie colony.:27.
Soon after settling in Los Angeles, Taylor's mother discovered that Hollywood people "habitually saw a movie future for every pretty face." Some of her mother's friends, and even total strangers, urged her to have Taylor screen tested for the role of Bonnie Blue, Scarlett's child in <a href="/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a>, then being filmed. Her mother refused the idea, as a child actress in film was alien to her. And in any regard, they would return to England after the war.:28.
Hollywood columnist <a href="/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> introduced the Taylors to Andrea Berens, the fiancée of <a href="/wiki/John_Cheever_Cowdin" title="John Cheever Cowdin">John Cheever Cowdin</a>, chairman and major <a href="/wiki/Stockholder" title="Stockholder" class="mw-redirect">stockholder</a> of <a href="/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures" class="mw-redirect">Universal Pictures</a>. Berens insisted that Sara take Taylor to see Cowden who, she assured, would be dazzled by her breathtaking beauty. <a href="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> also became interested in Taylor, and MGM head <a href="/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> reportedly told his producer, "Sign her up, sign her up! What are you waiting for?" As a result, she soon had both Universal and MGM willing to place her under contract. When Universal learned that MGM was equally interested, however, Cowden telephoned Universal from New York: "Sign her up, he ordered, don't even wait for the screen test." Universal then gave her a seven-year contract.:31.
Taylor appeared in her first motion picture at the age of nine in <a href="/wiki/There%27s_One_Born_Every_Minute" title="There's One Born Every Minute">There's One Born Every Minute</a> (1942), her only film for Universal. After less than a year, however, the studio fired Taylor for unknown reasons. Some speculate that she did not live up to Cowden's promise. Walker believes that Taylor's intuition told her "she wasn't really welcome at Universal." She learned, for instance, that her casting director complained, "The kid has nothing, " after a test. Even her beautiful eyes—they were a deep blue that appeared violet and stunned those who met her in person, with a <a href="/wiki/Distichiasis" title="Distichiasis" class="mw-redirect">mutation that gave Taylor double eyelashes</a>—did not impress him: "Her eyes are too old, she doesn't have the face of a child, " he said.:32 But Walker admits that "this was not so far off the mark as it may appear now." He explains:.
Taylor herself remembers that when she was a child in England, adults used to describe her as having an "old soul, " because, as she says, "I was totally direct." She also recognized similar traits in her baby daughter:.
Taylor's father served as an air raid warden with MGM producer <a href="/wiki/Sam_Marx" title="Sam Marx">Sam Marx</a>, and learned that the studio was searching for an English actress for a <a href="/wiki/Lassie" title="Lassie">Lassie</a> film. Taylor received the role and was offered a long-term contract at the beginning of 1943. She chose MGM because "the people there had been nicer to her when she went to audition, " Taylor recalled.:32 MGM's production chief, Benny Thau, was to remain the "only MGM executive" she fully trusted during subsequent years, because, writes Walker, "he had, out of kindly habit, made the gesture that showed her she was loved.":32 Thau remembered her as a "little dark-haired beauty...[with] those strange and lovely eyes that gave the face its central focus, oddly powerful in someone so young.":34 MGM, in addition, was considered a "glamorous studio, " boasting that it had "more stars than there are in heaven." Before Taylor's mother would sign the contract, however, she sought certainty that Taylor had a "God-given talent" to become an actress. Walker describes how they came to a decision:.
MGM cast Taylor in <a href="/wiki/Lassie_Come_Home" title="Lassie Come Home">Lassie Come Home</a> (1943) with child star <a href="/wiki/Roddy_McDowall" title="Roddy McDowall">Roddy McDowall</a>, with whom she would share a lifelong friendship. He later recalled regarding her beauty, "who has double eyelashes except a girl who was absolutely born to be on the big screen?" The film received favorable attention for both actors, and MGM signed Taylor to a conventional seven-year contract starting at $100 a week and with regular raises. Her first assignment under her new contract was a loan-out to <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> for the character of Helen Burns in a film version of the <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Bront%C3%AB" title="Charlotte Brontë">Charlotte Brontë</a> novel <a href="/wiki/Jane_Eyre_(1944_film)" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)" class="mw-redirect">Jane Eyre</a> (1944). Taylor returned to England to appear in another McDowall picture for MGM, <a href="/wiki/The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover_(1944_film)" title="The White Cliffs of Dover (1944 film)">The White Cliffs of Dover</a> (1944).
Taylor's persistence in seeking the role of Velvet Brown in MGM's <a href="/wiki/National_Velvet_(film)" title="National Velvet (film)">National Velvet</a> made her a star at the age of 12. Her character is a young girl who trains her beloved horse to win the <a href="/wiki/Aintree_Grand_National" title="Aintree Grand National" class="mw-redirect">Grand National</a>. Velvet, which costarred fellow young actor <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Rooney" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> and English newcomer <a href="/wiki/Angela_Lansbury" title="Angela Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>, became a great success upon its release in December 1944. Many years later Taylor called it "the most exciting film" she had ever made, although the film caused many of her later back problems due to her falling off a horse during filming.
Viewers and critics "fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor when they saw her in it." Walker explains why the film was popular:.
Velvet grossed over US$4&#160; million and MGM signed Taylor to a new long-term contract. Because of the movie's success she was cast in another animal film, <a href="/wiki/Courage_of_Lassie" title="Courage of Lassie">Courage of Lassie</a> (1946), in which Bill the dog outsmarts the <a href="/wiki/Nazis" title="Nazis" class="mw-redirect">Nazis</a>. The film's success led to another contract for Taylor paying her $750 per week. Her roles as Mary Skinner in a loan-out to <a href="/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers" class="mw-redirect">Warner Brothers</a>' <a href="/wiki/Life_with_Father_(film)" title="Life with Father (film)">Life With Father</a> (1947), Cynthia Bishop in Cynthia (1947), Carol Pringle in <a href="/wiki/A_Date_with_Judy_(film)" title="A Date with Judy (film)">A Date with Judy</a> (1948), and Susan Prackett in <a href="/wiki/Julia_Misbehaves" title="Julia Misbehaves">Julia Misbehaves</a> (1948) were all successful. Taylor received a reputation as a consistently successful adolescent actress, with a nickname of "One-Shot Liz" (referring to her ability to shoot a scene in one take) and a promising career. Taylor's portrayal of Amy in the American classic <a href="/wiki/Little_Women_(1949_film)" title="Little Women (1949 film)">Little Women</a> (1949) was her last adolescent role.
The teenage Taylor was reluctant to continue making films. Her <a href="/wiki/Stage_mother" title="Stage mother">stage mother</a> forced Taylor to relentlessly practice until she could cry on cue and watched her during filming, signaling to change her delivery or a mistake. Taylor met few others her age on movie sets, and was so poorly educated that she needed to use her fingers to do basic arithmetic. When at age 16 Taylor told her parents that she wanted to quit acting for a normal childhood, however, Sara Taylor told her that she was ungrateful: "You have a responsibility, Elizabeth. Not just to this family, but to the country now, the whole world".
In October 1948, Taylor sailed aboard the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary" title="RMS Queen Mary">RMS&#160; <i>Queen Mary</i></a> to England to begin filming <a href="/wiki/Conspirator_(1949_film)" title="Conspirator (1949 film)">Conspirator</a>. Unlike some other child actors, Taylor made an easy transition to adult roles. Before Conspirators 1949 release, a TIME cover article called her "a jewel of great price, a true star sapphire", and the leader among Hollywood's next generation of stars such as <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ava_Gardner" title="Ava Gardner">Ava Gardner</a>. The petite Taylor had the figure of a mature woman, with a 19" waist. Conspirator failed at the box office, but 16-year-old Taylor's portrayal of a 21-year-old debutante who unknowingly marries a communist spy played by 38-year-old <a href="/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor)" title="Robert Taylor (actor)">Robert Taylor</a>, was praised by critics for her first adult lead in a film. Taylor's first picture under her new salary of $2, 000 per week was The Big Hangover (1950), both a critical and box office failure, that paired her with screen idol <a href="/wiki/Van_Johnson" title="Van Johnson">Van Johnson</a>. The picture also failed to present Taylor with an opportunity to exhibit her newly realized sensuality.
Her first box office success in an adult role came as Kay Banks in the romantic comedy <a href="/wiki/Father_of_the_Bride_(1950_film)" title="Father of the Bride (1950 film)">Father of the Bride</a> (1950), alongside <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joan_Bennett" title="Joan Bennett">Joan Bennett</a>. The film spawned a sequel, <a href="/wiki/Father%27s_Little_Dividend" title="Father's Little Dividend">Father's Little Dividend</a> (1951), which Taylor's costar Spencer Tracy summarized with "boring… boring… boring". The film did well at the box office but it would be Taylor's next picture that would set the course for her career as a dramatic actress.
In late 1949, Taylor had begun filming <a href="/wiki/George_Stevens" title="George Stevens">George Stevens</a>' <a href="/wiki/A_Place_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="A Place in the Sun (film)">A Place in the Sun</a>. Upon its release in 1951, Taylor was hailed for her performance as Angela Vickers, a spoiled socialite who comes between George Eastman (Clift) and his poor, pregnant factory-working girlfriend Alice Tripp (<a href="/wiki/Shelley_Winters" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a>). The film, based on <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser" title="Theodore Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>'s novel, <a href="/wiki/An_American_Tragedy" title="An American Tragedy">An American Tragedy</a>, was an indictment of "the American dream" and its corrupting influences, notes biographer Kitty Kelley.
Although Taylor, then only 17, was unaware of the psychological implications of the story and its powerful nuances, it became the pivotal performance of Taylor's career. Kelley explains that Stevens, its director, knew that with Elizabeth Taylor as the young and beautiful star, the "audience would understand why George Eastman (Clift) would kill for a place in the sun with her." Hollywood columnist <a href="/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>, allowed on the set to watch the filming, became "wide-eyed watching the little girl from National Velvet seduce Montgomery Clift in front of the camera, " writes Kelley. When the scene was over, Hopper went to her, "Elizabeth, where on earth did you ever learn how to make love like that?".
Critics acclaimed the film as a classic, a reputation it sustained throughout the next 50 years of cinema history. <a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a> A.H. Weiler wrote, "Elizabeth's delineation of the rich and beauteous Angela is the top effort of her career", and the <a href="/wiki/Boxoffice_(magazine)" title="Boxoffice (magazine)">Boxoffice</a> reviewer unequivocally stated "Miss Taylor deserves an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>".
Taylor became increasingly unsatisfied with the roles being offered to her at the time. While she wanted to play the lead roles in <a href="/wiki/The_Barefoot_Contessa" title="The Barefoot Contessa">The Barefoot Contessa</a> and <a href="/wiki/I%27ll_Cry_Tomorrow" title="I'll Cry Tomorrow">I'll Cry Tomorrow</a>, MGM continued to restrict her to mindless and somewhat forgettable films such as: a cameo as herself in <a href="/wiki/Callaway_Went_Thataway" title="Callaway Went Thataway">Callaway Went Thataway</a> (1951), <a href="/wiki/Love_Is_Better_Than_Ever" title="Love Is Better Than Ever">Love Is Better Than Ever</a> (1952), <a href="/wiki/Ivanhoe_(1952_film)" title="Ivanhoe (1952 film)">Ivanhoe</a> (1952), <a href="/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Had_Everything" title="The Girl Who Had Everything">The Girl Who Had Everything</a> (1953) and Beau Brummel (1954). She had wanted to play the role of Lady Rowena in Ivanhoe, but the part was given to <a href="/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. Taylor was given the role of Rebecca. When Taylor became pregnant with her first child, MGM forced her through The Girl Who Had Everything (even adding two hours to her daily work schedule) so as to get one more film out of her before she became too heavily pregnant. Taylor lamented that she needed the money, as she had just bought a new house with second husband <a href="/wiki/Michael_Wilding_(actor)" title="Michael Wilding (actor)">Michael Wilding</a> and with a child on the way things would be pretty tight. Taylor had been forced by her pregnancy to turn down <a href="/wiki/Elephant_Walk" title="Elephant Walk">Elephant Walk</a> (1954), though the role had been designed for her. <a href="/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, almost two decades Taylor's senior, but to whom Taylor bore a striking resemblance, got the part and went to <a href="/wiki/Ceylon" title="Ceylon" class="mw-redirect">Ceylon</a> to shoot on location. Leigh suffered a nervous breakdown during filming, and Taylor reclaimed the role after the birth of her child Michael Wilding, Jr. in January 1953.
Taylor's next screen endeavor, <a href="/wiki/Rhapsody_(1954_film)" title="Rhapsody (1954 film)">Rhapsody</a> (1954), another tedious romantic drama, proved equally frustrating. Taylor portrayed Louise Durant, a beautiful rich girl in love with a temperamental violinist (<a href="/wiki/Vittorio_Gassman" title="Vittorio Gassman">Vittorio Gassman</a>) and an earnest young pianist (<a href="/wiki/John_Ericson" title="John Ericson">John Ericson</a>). A film critic for the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a> wrote: "There is beauty in the picture all right, with Miss Taylor glowing into the camera from every angle… but the dramatic pretenses are weak, despite the lofty sentences and handsome manikin poses.".
Taylor's fourth period picture, <a href="/wiki/Beau_Brummell_(film)" title="Beau Brummell (film)">Beau Brummell</a>, made just after Elephant Walk and Rhapsody, cast her as the elaborately costumed Lady Patricia, which many felt was only a screen prop—a ravishing beauty whose sole purpose was to lend romantic support to the film's title star, <a href="/wiki/Stewart_Granger" title="Stewart Granger">Stewart Granger</a>. <a href="/wiki/The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris" title="The Last Time I Saw Paris">The Last Time I Saw Paris</a> (1954) fared only slightly better than her previous pictures, with Taylor being reunited with The Big Hangover costar Van Johnson. The role of Helen Ellsworth Willis was based on that of <a href="/wiki/Zelda_Fitzgerald" title="Zelda Fitzgerald">Zelda Fitzgerald</a> and, although pregnant with her second child, Taylor went ahead with the film, her fourth in 12 months. Although proving somewhat successful at the box office, she still yearned for more substantial roles.
Following a more substantial role opposite <a href="/wiki/Rock_Hudson" title="Rock Hudson">Rock Hudson</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a> in <a href="/wiki/George_Stevens" title="George Stevens">George Stevens</a>' epic <a href="/wiki/Giant_(1956_film)" title="Giant (1956 film)">Giant</a> (1956), Taylor was nominated for an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> four years in a row for <a href="/wiki/Raintree_County_(film)" title="Raintree County (film)">Raintree County</a> (1957) opposite <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>; <a href="/wiki/Cat_on_a_Hot_Tin_Roof_(film)" title="Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (film)">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a> (1958) opposite <a href="/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>; <a href="/wiki/Suddenly, _Last_Summer_(film)" title="Suddenly, Last Summer (film)">Suddenly, Last Summer</a> (1959) with Montgomery Clift, <a href="/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mercedes_McCambridge" title="Mercedes McCambridge">Mercedes McCambridge</a>; and finally winning for <a href="/wiki/BUtterfield_8" title="BUtterfield 8">BUtterfield 8</a> (1960). The film co-starred then husband <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Fisher_(singer)" title="Eddie Fisher (singer)">Eddie Fisher</a> and ended her contract, which Taylor said had made her an "MGM chattel" for 18 years.
Suddenly, Last Summer's success made Taylor among the top ten most successful actors at the box office, and she remained in the top ten almost every year for the next decade. In 1960, Taylor became the highest paid actress up to that time when she signed a $1&#160; million dollar contract to play the title role in <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>'s lavish production of <a href="/wiki/Cleopatra_(1963_film)" title="Cleopatra (1963 film)">Cleopatra</a>, which was released in 1963. During the filming, she began a romance with her future husband <a href="/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>, who played <a href="/wiki/Mark_Antony" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> in the film. The romance received much attention from the tabloid press, as both were married to other spouses at the time. Taylor ultimately received $7&#160; million for her role.
Her second Academy Award, also for Best Actress in a Leading Role, was for her performance as Martha in <a href="/wiki/Who%27s_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf%3F_(film)" title="Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a> (1966), playing opposite then husband Richard Burton. Taylor and Burton would appear together in six other films during the decade, among them <a href="/wiki/The_V.I.P.s" title="The V.I.P.s">The V.I.P.s</a> (1963), <a href="/wiki/The_Sandpiper" title="The Sandpiper">The Sandpiper</a> (1965), and <a href="/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_(1967_film)" title="The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)">The Taming of the Shrew</a> (1967). By 1967 their films had earned $200&#160; million at the box office. When Taylor and Burton considered not working for three months, the possibility caused alarm in Hollywood as "nearly half of the U.S. film industry's income" came from movies starring one or both of them. Their next films <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(film)" title="Doctor Faustus (film)">Doctor Faustus</a> (1967), <a href="/wiki/The_Comedians_(1967_film)" title="The Comedians (1967 film)">The Comedians</a> (1967) and <a href="/wiki/Boom!_(1968_film)" title="Boom! (1968 film)">Boom!</a> (1968), however, all failed at the box office.
Taylor appeared in <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Reflections_in_a_Golden_Eye_(film)" title="Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)">Reflections in a Golden Eye</a> (1967) opposite <a href="/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> (replacing Clift, who died before production began) and <a href="/wiki/Secret_Ceremony" title="Secret Ceremony">Secret Ceremony</a> (1968) opposite <a href="/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a>. By the end of the decade her box-office drawing power had considerably diminished, as evidenced by the failure of <a href="/wiki/The_Only_Game_in_Town_(film)" title="The Only Game in Town (film)">The Only Game in Town</a> (1970), with <a href="/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>.
Although limited by a "thin and inflexible voice", Taylor continued to star in numerous theatrical films throughout the 1970s, such as <a href="/wiki/Zee_and_Co." title="Zee and Co.">Zee and Co.</a> (1972) with <a href="/wiki/Michael_Caine" title="Michael Caine">Michael Caine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ash_Wednesday" title="Ash Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a> (1973), <a href="/wiki/The_Blue_Bird_(film)" title="The Blue Bird (film)">The Blue Bird</a> (1976) with <a href="/wiki/Jane_Fonda" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a> and Ava Gardner, and <a href="/wiki/A_Little_Night_Music" title="A Little Night Music">A&#160; Little Night Music</a> (1977).

She appeared on a number of television series, including the soap operas <a href="/wiki/General_Hospital" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a> and <a href="/wiki/All_My_Children" title="All My Children">All My Children</a>, as well as the animated series <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>—once as herself, and once as the voice of <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Simpson" title="Maggie Simpson">Maggie Simpson</a>, uttering one word, "Daddy".
Taylor also acted on the stage, making her Broadway and West End debuts in 1982 with a revival of <a href="/wiki/Lillian_Hellman" title="Lillian Hellman">Lillian Hellman</a>'s <a href="/wiki/The_Little_Foxes" title="The Little Foxes">The Little Foxes</a>. She was then in a production of <a href="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="Noël Coward">Noël Coward</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Private_Lives" title="Private Lives">Private Lives</a> (1983), in which she starred with her former husband, Richard Burton. The student-run <a href="/wiki/Burton_Taylor_Theatre" title="Burton Taylor Theatre" class="mw-redirect">Burton Taylor Theatre</a> in Oxford was named for the famous couple after Burton appeared as Doctor Faustus in the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS) production of the Marlowe play. Taylor played the ghostly, wordless <a href="/wiki/Helen_of_Troy" title="Helen of Troy">Helen of Troy</a>, who is entreated by Faustus to "make [him] immortal with a kiss".
In the early 1980s, Taylor moved to <a href="/wiki/Bel_Air, _Los_Angeles" title="Bel Air, Los Angeles">Bel Air, Los Angeles</a>, which was her residence until her death. She also owned homes in Palm Springs, London and Hawaii.
In March 2003, Taylor declined to attend the 75th Annual Academy Awards, due to her opposition to the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>. She publicly condemned then <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> for calling on <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> to leave Iraq, and said she feared the conflict would lead to "<a href="/wiki/World_War_III" title="World War III">World War III</a>".
The February 2007 issue of <a href="/wiki/Interview_(magazine)" title="Interview (magazine)">Interview</a> magazine was devoted entirely to Taylor. It celebrated her life, career and her upcoming 75th birthday.
On December 1, 2007, Taylor acted on-stage again, appearing opposite <a href="/wiki/James_Earl_Jones" title="James Earl Jones">James Earl Jones</a> in a benefit performance of the <a href="/wiki/A._R._Gurney" title="A. R. Gurney">A. R. Gurney</a> play <a href="/wiki/Love_Letters_(play)" title="Love Letters (play)">Love Letters</a>. The event's goal was to raise $1&#160; million for Taylor's AIDS foundation. Tickets for the show were priced at $2, 500, and more than 500 people attended. The event happened to coincide with the <a href="/wiki/2007_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike" title="2007 Writers Guild of America strike" class="mw-redirect">2007 Writers Guild of America strike</a> and, rather than cross the picket line, Taylor requested a "one night dispensation." The Writers Guild agreed not to picket the <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> lot that night to allow for the performance.
Taylor was married eight times to seven husbands. When asked why she married so often, she replied, "I don't know, honey. It sure beats the hell out of me, " but also said that, "I was taught by my parents that if you fall in love, if you want to have a love affair, you get married. I guess I'm very old-fashioned." Taylor's husbands were:.
Taylor had many romances outside her marriages. Before marrying Hilton she was engaged to both <a href="/wiki/Heisman_Trophy" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Davis_(American_football)" title="Glenn Davis (American football)">Glenn Davis</a>—who did not know until the relationship ended that Taylor's mother had encouraged it to build publicity for her daughter—and the son of <a href="/wiki/William_D._Pawley" title="William D. Pawley">William D. Pawley</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Brazil" title="United States Ambassador to Brazil">United States Ambassador to Brazil</a>. <a href="/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> promised Taylor's parents that if they would encourage her to marry him, the enormously wealthy industrialist and film producer would finance a movie studio for her; Sara Taylor agreed, but Taylor refused. After she left Hilton Hughes returned, proposing to Taylor by suddenly landing a helicopter nearby and sprinkling diamonds on her. Other dates included <a href="/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Kissinger" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Forbes" title="Malcolm Forbes">Malcolm Forbes</a>. In 2007, Taylor denied rumors of a ninth marriage to her partner Jason Winters, but referred to him as "one of the most wonderful men I've ever known.".
Taylor had two sons, Michael Howard (born January 6, 1953) and Christopher Edward (born February 27, 1955), with Michael Wilding. She had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances "Liza" (born August 6, 1957), with Michael Todd. During her marriage to Eddie Fisher, Taylor started proceedings to adopt a two-year-old girl from Germany, Maria (born August 1, 1961); the adoption process was finalized in 1964 following their divorce. Richard Burton later adopted Taylor's daughters Liza and Maria.
In 1971, Taylor became a grandmother at the age of 39. At the time of her death, she was survived by her four children, ten grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
In 1959, at age 27, after nine months of study, Taylor <a href="/wiki/List_of_converts_to_Judaism" title="List of converts to Judaism">converted</a> from <a href="/wiki/Christian_Science" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a> to Judaism, taking the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew" title="Hebrew" class="mw-redirect">Hebrew</a> name Elisheba Rachel. She stated that her conversion was something she had long considered and was not related to her marriages. After <a href="/wiki/Mike_Todd" title="Mike Todd">Mike Todd</a>'s death, Taylor said that she "felt a desperate need for a formalized religion, " and explained that neither Catholicism nor Christian Science were able to address many of the "questions she had about life and death.":175.
Biographer Randy Taraborrelli notes that after studying the philosophy of Judaism for nine months, "she felt an immediate connection to the faith.":176 Although Taylor rarely attended synagogue, she stated, "I'm one of those people who think you can be close to God anywhere, not just in a place designed for worship... ":176 At the conversion ceremony, with her parents present as witnesses and in full support of her decision, Taylor repeated the words of <a href="/wiki/Ruth_(biblical_figure)" title="Ruth (biblical figure)">Ruth</a>:.
... for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people and thy God my God.:176.
Taylor was a follower of <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah_Centre" title="Kabbalah Centre">Kabbalah Centre</a>.
During an interview when she was 55, she describes how her inner sense of identity, when a child actress, kept her from giving in to many of the studio's demands, especially with regard to altering her appearance to fit in:.
She adds that she began to recognize her "inner being" during her adulthood:.
Taylor had a passion for <a href="/wiki/Jewelry" title="Jewelry" class="mw-redirect">jewelry</a>, stating that "You can't cry on a diamond's shoulder, and diamonds won't keep you warm at night, but they're sure fun when the sun shines". At her death, Taylor's jewelry collection was reportedly worth $150&#160; million. She was a client of jewelry designer <a href="/wiki/Shlomo_Moussaieff_(businessman)" title="Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)">Shlomo Moussaieff</a>. Over the years she owned a number of well-known pieces, two of the most famous being the 33.19-carat (6.64&#160; g) <a href="/wiki/Krupp_Diamond" title="Krupp Diamond">Krupp Diamond</a>, which Taylor wore daily, and the 69.42-carat (13.88&#160; g) pear-shaped <a href="/wiki/Taylor-Burton_Diamond" title="Taylor-Burton Diamond">Taylor-Burton Diamond</a>; both were among many gifts from husband Richard Burton. Taylor also owned the 50-carat (10&#160; g) <a href="/wiki/La_Peregrina_Pearl" title="La Peregrina Pearl" class="mw-redirect">La Peregrina Pearl</a>, purchased by Burton as a Valentine's Day present in 1969. The pearl was formerly owned by <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England" title="Mary I of England">Mary I of England</a>, and Burton sought a portrait of Queen Mary wearing the pearl. Upon the purchase of such a painting, the Burtons discovered that the British <a href="/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery_(United_Kingdom)" title="National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)" class="mw-redirect">National Portrait Gallery</a> did not have an original painting of Mary, so they donated the painting to the Gallery. Her enduring collection of jewelry has been documented in her book My Love Affair with Jewelry (2002) with photographs by the New York photographer <a href="/wiki/John_Bigelow_Taylor" title="John Bigelow Taylor">John Bigelow Taylor</a>.
At her death Taylor left an estate estimated at $600&#160; million to $1&#160; billion; beyond the $150&#160; million in jewelry, she owned $130&#160; million in real estate. Taylor was a pioneer in marketing a celebrity merchandise brand, and despite her years as an actress, most of Taylor's wealth came from her business ventures. She designed fine jewelry for The Elizabeth Collection, and launched three perfumes, "White Diamonds", "Passion", and "Passion for Men", which together had an estimated US$69&#160; million in 2010 sales.
Taylor was a fashion icon during her years as an active film star. In addition to her own purchases, MGM costumers <a href="/wiki/Edith_Head" title="Edith Head">Edith Head</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helen_Rose" title="Helen Rose">Helen Rose</a> helped Taylor choose clothes that emphasized her face, chest, and waist. Taylor helped popularize <a href="/wiki/Valentino_Garavani" title="Valentino Garavani">Valentino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Halston" title="Halston">Halston</a>'s designs, and in the 1980s <a href="/wiki/Schering-Plough" title="Schering-Plough">Schering-Plough</a> developed violet <a href="/wiki/Contact_lens" title="Contact lens">contact lenses</a>, citing Taylor's eyes as inspiration.
Taylor devoted consistent and generous <a href="/wiki/Humanitarian" title="Humanitarian" class="mw-redirect">humanitarian</a> time, advocacy efforts, and funding to HIV and AIDS-related projects and charities, helping to raise more than $270&#160; million for the cause. She was one of the first celebrities and public personalities to do so at a time when few acknowledged the disease, organizing and hosting the first AIDS fundraiser in 1984, to benefit <a href="/wiki/AIDS_Project_Los_Angeles" title="AIDS Project Los Angeles">AIDS Project Los Angeles</a>.
Taylor was cofounder of the <a href="/wiki/American_Foundation_for_AIDS_Research" title="American Foundation for AIDS Research" class="mw-redirect">American Foundation for AIDS Research</a> (<a href="/wiki/AmfAR" title="AmfAR" class="mw-redirect">amfAR</a>) with Dr. <a href="/wiki/Michael_S._Gottlieb" title="Michael S. Gottlieb">Michael Gottlieb</a> and Dr. <a href="/wiki/Mathilde_Krim" title="Mathilde Krim">Mathilde Krim</a> in 1985. Her longtime friend and former co-star <a href="/wiki/Rock_Hudson" title="Rock Hudson">Rock Hudson</a> had disclosed having AIDS and died of it that year. She also founded the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) in 1993, created to provide critically needed support services for people with HIV/AIDS. For example, in 2006 Taylor commissioned a 37-foot (11&#160; m) "Care Van" equipped with examination tables and xray equipment, the New Orleans donation made by her Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation and <a href="/wiki/Macy%27s" title="Macy's">Macy's</a>. That year, in the wake of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, she also donated US$40, 000 to the NO/AIDS Task Force, a non-profit organization serving the community of those affected by HIV/AIDS in and around New Orleans.
Taylor was honored with a special Academy Award, the <a href="/wiki/Jean_Hersholt_Humanitarian_Award" title="Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award">Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award</a>, in 1992 for her HIV/AIDS humanitarian work. Speaking of that work, former President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> said at her death, "Elizabeth's legacy will live on in many people around the world whose lives will be longer and better because of her work and the ongoing efforts of those she inspired.".
After her <a href="/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism" title="Conversion to Judaism">conversion to Judaism</a>, Taylor worked for Jewish causes throughout her life. In 1959, her large-scale purchase of <a href="/wiki/State_of_Israel_Bonds" title="State of Israel Bonds">Israeli Bonds</a> caused <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab" class="mw-redirect">Arab</a> boycotts of her films. In 1962, she was barred from entering <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to complete Cleopatra; its government announced that "that Miss Taylor will not be allowed to come to Egypt because she has adopted the Jewish faith and 'supports Israeli causes.'" In 1974, Taylor and Richard Burton considered marrying in Israel, but could not because Burton was not Jewish. Taylor helped to raise money for organizations such as the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund" title="Jewish National Fund">Jewish National Fund</a>; advocated for the right of <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia" title="History of the Jews in Russia">Soviet Jews</a> to <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" title="Aliyah">emigate to Israel</a> and canceled a visit to the USSR because of its condemnation of Israel due to the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>; signed a letter protesting the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379">United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379</a> of 1975; and offered herself as a replacement hostage during the 1976 <a href="/wiki/Operation_Entebbe" title="Operation Entebbe">Entebbe skyjacking</a>.
Taylor struggled with health problems much of her life; starting with her divorce from Hilton, Taylor experienced serious medical issues whenever she faced problems in her personal life. Taylor was hospitalized more than 70 times and had at least 20 major operations. Many times newspaper headlines erroneously announced that Taylor was close to death; she herself only claimed to have almost died on four occasions.
At 5'4", Taylor constantly <a href="/wiki/Yo-yo_dieting" title="Yo-yo dieting" class="mw-redirect">gained and lost significant amounts of weight</a>, reaching both 119 pounds and 180 pounds in the 1980s. She smoked cigarettes into her mid-fifties, and feared she had lung cancer in October 1975 after an <a href="/wiki/X-ray" title="X-ray">X-ray</a> showed spots on her lungs, but was later found not to have the disease. Taylor broke her back five times, had both her <a href="/wiki/Hip_replacement" title="Hip replacement">hips replaced</a>, had a <a href="/wiki/Hysterectomy" title="Hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>, suffered from <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phlebitis" title="Phlebitis">phlebitis</a>, punctured her <a href="/wiki/Esophagus" title="Esophagus">esophagus</a>, survived a benign <a href="/wiki/Brain_tumor" title="Brain tumor">brain tumor</a> operation in 1997 and <a href="/wiki/Skin_cancer" title="Skin cancer" class="mw-redirect">skin cancer</a>, and faced life-threatening bouts with pneumonia twice, one in 1961 requiring an emergency <a href="/wiki/Tracheotomy" title="Tracheotomy">tracheotomy</a>. In 1983 she admitted to having been addicted to <a href="/wiki/Hypnotic" title="Hypnotic">sleeping pills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Painkillers" title="Painkillers" class="mw-redirect">painkillers</a> for 35 years. Taylor was treated for alcoholism and prescription drug addiction at the <a href="/wiki/Betty_Ford_Clinic" title="Betty Ford Clinic" class="mw-redirect">Betty Ford Clinic</a> for seven weeks from December 1983 to January 1984, and again from the autumn of 1988 until early 1989.
On May 30, 2006, Taylor appeared on <a href="/wiki/Larry_King_Live" title="Larry King Live">Larry King Live</a> to refute the claims that she had been ill, and denied the allegations that she was suffering from <a href="/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" title="Alzheimer's disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> and was close to death. Near the end of her life, however, she was reclusive and sometimes failed to make scheduled appearances due to illness or other personal reasons. She used a wheelchair and when asked about it stated that she had <a href="/wiki/Osteoporosis" title="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a> and was born with <a href="/wiki/Scoliosis" title="Scoliosis">scoliosis</a>.
The mutation that gave Taylor her striking double eyelashes may also have contributed to her history of heart trouble. In November 2004, Taylor announced a diagnosis of <a href="/wiki/Heart_failure" title="Heart failure">congestive heart failure</a>, a progressive condition in which the heart is too weak to pump sufficient blood throughout the body, particularly to the lower extremities such as the ankles and feet. In 2009 she underwent <a href="/wiki/Cardiac_surgery" title="Cardiac surgery">cardiac surgery</a> to replace a leaky <a href="/wiki/Heart_valve" title="Heart valve">valve</a>. In February 2011, new symptoms related to heart failure caused her to be admitted into <a href="/wiki/Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center" title="Cedars-Sinai Medical Center">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a> in Los Angeles for treatment, where she remained until her death at age 79 on March 23, 2011, surrounded by her four children.
She was buried in a private <a href="/wiki/Bereavement_in_Judaism" title="Bereavement in Judaism">Jewish ceremony</a>, presided over by <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" title="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> Jerry Cutler, the day after she died, at <a href="/wiki/Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park, _Glendale" title="Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> in Glendale, California. Taylor is entombed in the Great Mausoleum, where public access to her tomb is restricted. At her request, the funeral began 15 minutes after it was scheduled to begin; as her representative told the media "She even wanted to be late for her own funeral.".
Taylor has been called the "greatest movie star of all, " writes biographer William J. Mann.:2 A child star at the age of 12, she soon after launched into public awareness by <a href="/wiki/MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a> and a string of successful films, many of which are today considered "classics." Her resulting celebrity made her into a Hollywood icon, as she set the "gold standard" for Hollywood fame, and "created the model for stardom, " adds Mann.:3.
Other observers, such as social critic <a href="/wiki/Camille_Paglia" title="Camille Paglia">Camille Paglia</a>, similarly describe Taylor as "the greatest actress in film history, " partly as a result of the "liquid realm of emotion" she expressed on screen. Paglia describes the effect Taylor had in some of her films:.
Taylor had a major role in sparking the <a href="/wiki/Sexual_revolution" title="Sexual revolution">sexual revolution</a> of the 1960s, as she pushed the envelope on sexuality: She was one of the first major stars to pose (mostly) nude in Playboy, and among the first to remove her clothes onscreen.:5 In A Place in the Sun, filmed when she was 17, her surprising maturity shocked Hollywood columnist <a href="/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>, who wrote of her precocious sexuality. Film historian <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> describes her love scenes in the film with <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> as "unnerving—sybaritic—like gorging on chocolate sundaes.":6.
In real life, she was considered "a star without airs, " notes Mann. Writer <a href="/wiki/Gloria_Steinem" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> likewise described her as a "movie queen with no ego... expert at what she does, uncatty in her work relationships with other actresses.":7 <a href="/wiki/Mike_Nichols" title="Mike Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>, who directed her in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), said that of all the actors he’s worked with, Taylor had the "most democratic soul." Mann adds that she treated electricians and studio crew the "same way she would a Rothschild at a charity gala.":6 Director <a href="/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a> told Taylor that she possessed "that rarest of virtues—simple kindness.":7.
Taylor won two Academy Awards for Best Actress for her performance in BUtterfield 8 in 1960, and for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966. Additionally, she received the <a href="/wiki/Jean_Hersholt_Humanitarian_Award" title="Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award">Jean Herscholt Humanitarian Academy Award</a> in 1992 for her work fighting AIDS.
In 1997, Taylor was honored by the <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> (SAG) with the Life Achievement Award. As Taylor could not be in attendance, <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a> read the following statement on her behalf:.
As we all know, ours was one of the first industries to be directly and dramatically affected by the AIDS epidemic. And it’s heartening to me that this community has risen to the challenge. And the foundation of the Screen Actors Guild, of which I’m so proud to be a member, is no exception having made a very generous donation to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. Thank you all for honoring me tonight.
Love, Elizabeth.
Taylor received the French <a href="/wiki/Legion_of_Honour" title="Legion of Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1987, and in 2000 was named a <a href="/wiki/Dame_Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire" class="mw-redirect">Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>. In 2001, she received a <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Citizens_Medal" title="Presidential Citizens Medal">Presidential Citizens Medal</a> for her humanitarian work, most notably for helping to raise more than $200&#160; million for AIDS research and bringing international attention and resources to addressing the epidemic. Taylor was inducted into the <a href="/wiki/California_Hall_of_Fame" title="California Hall of Fame">California Hall of Fame</a> in 2007.
Taylor was the subject of at least 53 books as of 2006; <a href="/wiki/Kitty_Kelley" title="Kitty Kelley">Kitty Kelley</a> wrote the first unauthorized biography of the actress in 1981, which Taylor denounced. She never wrote a comprehensive autobiography due to her desire for privacy, but did publish several books besides My Love Affair with Jewelry. Taylor's first, Nibbles and Me (1946), discussed the child star's "adventures with her pet chipmunk". Reviewers criticized another, Elizabeth Taylor (1964), for being uninteresting and lacking in new information. She received a $750, 000 <a href="/wiki/Advance_payment" title="Advance payment">advance payment</a> for Elizabeth Takes Off: On Weight Gain, Weight Loss, Self-Image and Self-Esteem (1988).
