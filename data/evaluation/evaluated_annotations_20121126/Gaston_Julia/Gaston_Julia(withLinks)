Gaston Maurice Julia (February 3, 1893 – March 19, 1978) was a <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> who devised the formula for the <a href="/wiki/Julia_set" title="Julia set">Julia set</a>. His works were popularized by French mathematician <a href="/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot" title="Benoit Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a>; the Julia and Mandelbrot <a href="/wiki/Fractal" title="Fractal">fractals</a> are closely related.
Julia was born in the <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algerian</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Sidi_Bel_Abbes" title="Sidi Bel Abbes" class="mw-redirect">Sidi Bel Abbes</a>, at the time governed by the <a href="/wiki/French_Algeria" title="French Algeria">French</a>. During his youth, he had an interest in mathematics and music. His studies were interrupted at the age of 21 years old, when France became involved with <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and he was conscripted to serve with the army. During an attack he suffered a severe injury, losing his nose. His many operations to remedy the situation were all unsuccessful, and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.
Julia gained attention for his mathematical work after the war when a 199-page article he wrote was featured in the <a href="/wiki/Journal_de_Math%C3%A9matiques_Pures_et_Appliqu%C3%A9es" title="Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées">Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées</a>, a <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematics_journal" title="Mathematics journal">mathematics journal</a>. The article, which he published during 1918 at the age of 25, titled "Mémoire sur l'itération des fonctions rationnelles" described the iteration of a <a href="/wiki/Rational_function" title="Rational function">rational function</a>. The article gained immense popularity among mathematicians and the general population as a whole, and so resulted in Julia's later receiving of the Grand Prix de <a href="/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences" title="Académie des Sciences" class="mw-redirect">l'Académie des Sciences</a>. Despite his fame, his works were mostly forgotten until the day <a href="/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot" title="Benoit Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> mentioned them in his works.
