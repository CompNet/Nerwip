George Rogers Clark (November 19, 1752 â€“ February 13, 1818) was a soldier from <a href="/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>. He served as leader of the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> (then part of Virginia) <a href="/wiki/Militia_(United_States)" title="Militia (United States)">militia</a> throughout much of the war. Clark is best known for his celebrated captures of <a href="/wiki/Kaskaskia, _Illinois" title="Kaskaskia, Illinois">Kaskaskia</a> (1778) and <a href="/wiki/Vincennes, _Indiana" title="Vincennes, Indiana">Vincennes</a> (1779), which greatly weakened <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">British</a> influence in the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Territory" title="Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a>. Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">1783 Treaty of Paris</a>, Clark has often been hailed as the "Conqueror of the Old Northwest.".
Clark's military achievements all came before his 30th birthday. Afterwards he led militia in the opening engagements of the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War" title="Northwest Indian War">Northwest Indian War</a>, but was accused of being drunk on duty. Despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations, he was disgraced and forced to resign. He left Kentucky to live on the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Territory" title="Indiana Territory">Indiana</a> frontier. Never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures, Clark spent the final decades of his life evading creditors, and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed conspiracies to open the <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a>-controlled <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> to American traffic. After suffering a stroke and losing his leg, Clark was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother <a href="/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer)" title="William Clark (explorer)">William</a>, one of the leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition" title="Lewis and Clark Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. Clark died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.
George Rogers Clark was born on November 19, 1752 in <a href="/wiki/Charlottesville, _Virginia" title="Charlottesville, Virginia">Charlottesville, Virginia</a>, not far from the home of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. He was the second of ten children of John Clark and Ann Rogers Clark, who were <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" title="Anglicanism">Anglicans</a> of English and Scots ancestry. Five of their six sons became officers during the American Revolutionary War. Their youngest son, <a href="/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer)" title="William Clark (explorer)">William Clark</a>, was too young to fight in the Revolution, but later became famous as a leader of the <a href="/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition" title="Lewis and Clark Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. In about 1756, after the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> (part of the worldwide <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>), the family moved away from the frontier to <a href="/wiki/Caroline_County, _Virginia" title="Caroline County, Virginia">Caroline County, Virginia</a>, and lived on a 400-acre (1.6&#160; km2) <a href="/wiki/Plantation" title="Plantation">plantation</a> that later grew to over 2, 000 acres (8.1&#160; km2).
Little is known of Clark's schooling. He lived with his grandfather so he could attend Donald Robertson's school with <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Taylor_of_Caroline" title="John Taylor of Caroline">John Taylor of Caroline</a> and received a common education. He was also tutored at home, as was usual for Virginian planters' children of the period. Becoming a planter, he was taught to <a href="/wiki/Surveyor_(surveying)" title="Surveyor (surveying)" class="mw-redirect">survey</a> land by his grandfather.
At age nineteen, Clark left his home on his first surveying trip into western Virginia. In 1772, as a twenty-year-old surveyor, Clark made his first trip into Kentucky via the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> at <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. Thousands of settlers were entering the area as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Stanwix" title="Treaty of Fort Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a> of 1768. In 1774, Clark was preparing to lead an expedition of ninety men down the Ohio River when war broke out with the <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">American Indians</a>. Although most of Kentucky was not inhabited by Indians, several tribes used the area for hunting. The tribes living in the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_country" title="Ohio country" class="mw-redirect">Ohio country</a> had not been party to the treaty signed with the <a href="/wiki/Cherokee" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, which ceded the Kentucky hunting grounds to Britain for settlement. They attacked the European-American settlers to try to push them out of the area, conflicts that eventually culminated in <a href="/wiki/Lord_Dunmore%27s_War" title="Lord Dunmore's War" class="mw-redirect">Lord Dunmore's War</a>. Clark served in the war as a <a href="/wiki/Captain_(land)" title="Captain (land)" class="mw-redirect">captain</a> in the Virginia militia.
As the American Revolutionary War began in the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_United_States" title="Eastern United States">East</a>, settlers in Kentucky were involved in a dispute over the region's sovereignty. <a href="/wiki/Richard_Henderson_(jurist)" title="Richard Henderson (jurist)">Richard Henderson</a>, a judge and land speculator from <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a <a href="/wiki/Proprietary_colony" title="Proprietary colony">proprietary colony</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Transylvania_(colony)" title="Transylvania (colony)">Transylvania</a>, but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania's authority over them. In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and <a href="/wiki/John_Gabriel_Jones" title="John Gabriel Jones">John Gabriel Jones</a> to deliver a petition to the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly" title="Virginia General Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a>, asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky. Clark and Jones traveled via the <a href="/wiki/Wilderness_Road" title="Wilderness Road">Wilderness Road</a> to <a href="/wiki/Williamsburg, _Virginia" title="Williamsburg, Virginia">Williamsburg</a>, where they convinced Governor <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Henry" title="Patrick Henry">Patrick Henry</a> to create <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_County, _Virginia" title="Kentucky County, Virginia">Kentucky County, Virginia</a>. Clark was given 500&#160; lb (230&#160; kg) of gunpowder to help defend the settlements and was appointed a <a href="/wiki/Major_(United_States)" title="Major (United States)">major</a> in the Kentucky County militia. Clark was just 24 years old, but older settlers such as <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Boone" title="Daniel Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Logan" title="Benjamin Logan">Benjamin Logan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Helm" title="Leonard Helm">Leonard Helm</a> looked to him as a leader.
In 1777, the American Revolutionary War intensified in Kentucky. Armed and encouraged by British lieutenant governor <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hamilton_(governor)" title="Henry Hamilton (governor)">Henry Hamilton</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Detroit" title="Fort Detroit">Fort Detroit</a>, Native Americans waged war and raided the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The <a href="/wiki/Continental_Army" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a> could spare no men for an invasion of the Northwest or the defense of distant Kentucky, so its defense was left entirely to the local population. Clark participated in several skirmishes against the Native American raiders. As a leader of the defense of Kentucky, Clark believed that the best way to end these raids was to seize British outposts north of the Ohio River, thereby destroying British influence with the Indians. Clark asked Governor Henry for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the nearest British posts, which were located in the <a href="/wiki/Illinois_country" title="Illinois country" class="mw-redirect">Illinois country</a>. Governor Henry commissioned Clark as a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)" title="Lieutenant colonel (United States)">lieutenant colonel</a> in the Virginia militia and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition.
In July 1778, Clark and about 175&#160; men crossed the Ohio River at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Massac" title="Fort Massac">Fort Massac</a> and marched to <a href="/wiki/Kaskaskia, _Illinois" title="Kaskaskia, Illinois">Kaskaskia</a>, taking it on the night of July 4. <a href="/wiki/Cahokia, _Illinois" title="Cahokia, Illinois">Cahokia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vincennes, _Indiana" title="Vincennes, Indiana">Vincennes</a>, and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot, because most of the French-speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British. To counter Clark's advance, Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force. In February 1779, Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town, capturing Hamilton in the process. The winter expedition was Clark's most significant military achievement and became the source of his reputation as an early American military hero. When news of his victory reached General <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, Clark's success was celebrated and was used to encourage the <a href="/wiki/Franco-American_alliance" title="Franco-American alliance">alliance with France</a>. Washington recognized his achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds. Virginia capitalized on Clark's success by laying claim to the whole of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Northwest" title="Old Northwest" class="mw-redirect">Old Northwest</a>, calling it Illinois County.
Clark's ultimate goal during the Revolutionary War was to seize British-held Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men to make the attempt. The Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky rather than making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. In June 1780, a mixed force of British and Indians, including Shawnee, Delaware, Wyandot and others, from Detroit <a href="/wiki/Bird%27s_Invasion_of_Kentucky" title="Bird's Invasion of Kentucky" class="mw-redirect">invaded Kentucky</a> with cannons, capturing two fortified settlements and carrying away hundreds of prisoners. In August 1780, Clark led a retaliatory force that won a victory at the Shawnee village of Peckuwe, at what is now called George Rogers Clark Park near <a href="/wiki/Springfield, _Ohio" title="Springfield, Ohio">Springfield, Ohio</a>.
The next year Clark was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)" title="Brigadier general (United States)">brigadier general</a> by Governor Thomas Jefferson, and was given command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties. He prepared again to lead an expedition against Detroit. Although Washington transferred a small group of regulars to assist Clark, the detachment was <a href="/wiki/Lochry%27s_Defeat" title="Lochry's Defeat">disastrously defeated</a> in August 1781 before they could meet up with Clark, ending the campaign.
In August 1782, another British-Indian force defeated the Kentucky militia at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Blue_Licks" title="Battle of Blue Licks">Battle of Blue Licks</a>. Although Clark had not been present at the battle, as senior military officer, he was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster. In response, Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Piqua" title="Battle of Piqua">destroying several Indian towns</a> along the <a href="/wiki/Great_Miami_River" title="Great Miami River">Great Miami River</a> in the last major expedition of the war.
The importance of Clark's activities in the Revolutionary War has been the subject of much debate among historians. As early as 1779 he was called the Conqueror of the Northwest by <a href="/wiki/George_Mason" title="George Mason">George Mason</a>. Because the British ceded the entire Old <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Territory" title="Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a> to the United States in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">1783 Treaty of Paris</a>, some historians, including <a href="/wiki/William_Hayden_English" title="William Hayden English">William Hayden English</a>, credit Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original <a href="/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies" title="Thirteen Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> by seizing control of the Illinois country during the war. Clark's Illinois campaignâ€”particularly the surprise march to Vincennesâ€”was greatly celebrated and romanticized. Other historians, such as Lowell Harrison, have downplayed the importance of the campaign in the peace negotiations and the outcome of the war, arguing that Clark's "conquest" was little more than a temporary occupation.
Clark was just thirty years old when the Revolutionary War ended, but his greatest military achievements were already behind him. Ever since Clark's victories in Illinois, settlers had been pouring into Kentucky, often illegally squatting on Indian land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 until 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans and surveyed the lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought a small income, but Clark devoted very little time to the enterprise. Clark helped to negotiate the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_McIntosh" title="Treaty of Fort McIntosh">Treaty of Fort McIntosh</a> in 1785 and the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Finney" title="Treaty of Fort Finney">Treaty of Fort Finney</a> in 1786 with tribes north of the river, but violence between Native Americans and Kentucky settlers continued to escalate.
According to a 1790 U.S. government report, 1, 500&#160; Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War. In an attempt to end these raids, Clark led an expedition of 1, 200&#160; drafted men against Indian towns on the <a href="/wiki/Wabash_River" title="Wabash River">Wabash River</a> in 1786, one of the first actions of the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War" title="Northwest Indian War">Northwest Indian War</a>. The campaign ended without a victory: lacking supplies, about three hundred militiamen <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutinied</a>, and Clark had to withdraw, but not before concluding a ceasefire with the Indians. It was rumored, most notably by <a href="/wiki/James_Wilkinson" title="James Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>, that Clark had often been drunk on duty. Many years later, Wilkinson was found to be working as a secret agent of the <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> government. When Clark learned of the rumors he demanded an official inquiry be made, but his request was declined by Governor of Virginia, and Virginia Council condemned Clark's actions. Clark's reputation was tarnished, he never again led men in battle, and he left Kentucky, moving into the <a href="/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a> frontier near <a href="/wiki/Clarksville, _Indiana" title="Clarksville, Indiana">Clarksville</a>.
Clark lived most of the rest of his life in financial difficulties. Clark had financed the majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds. When creditors began to come to him for these unpaid debts, he was unable to obtain recompense from Virginia or the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> because record keeping on the frontier during the war had been haphazard. For his services in the war Virginia gave Clark a gift of 150, 000 acres (610&#160; km2) of land. The soldiers who fought with Clark also received smaller tracts of land. Together with <a href="/wiki/Clark%27s_Grant" title="Clark's Grant">Clark's Grant</a> and his other holdings, his ownership encompassed all of present day <a href="/wiki/Clark_County, _Indiana" title="Clark County, Indiana">Clark County, Indiana</a> and most of the surrounding counties. Although Clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land resulting from his military service and land speculation, he was "land-poor, " meaning that he owned much land but lacked the means to make money from it.
With his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful, on February 2, 1793, Clark offered his services to <a href="/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt" title="Edmond-Charles GenÃªt">Edmond-Charles GenÃªt</a>, the controversial ambassador of <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_France" title="Revolutionary France" class="mw-redirect">revolutionary France</a>, hoping to earn money to maintain his estate. Western Americans were outraged that the Spanish, who controlled <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_(New_Spain)" title="Louisiana (New Spain)">Louisiana</a>, denied Americans free access to the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, their only easy outlet for long distance commerce. The <a href="/wiki/Washington_Administration" title="Washington Administration" class="mw-redirect">Washington Administration</a> was also seemingly deaf to western concerns about opening the Mississippi to U.S. commerce. Clark proposed to GenÃªt that, with French financial support, he could lead an expedition to drive the Spanish out of the Mississippi Valley. GenÃªt appointed Clark "Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River." Clark began to organize a campaign to seize <a href="/wiki/New_Madrid, _Missouri" title="New Madrid, Missouri">New Madrid</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Louis, _Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Natchez, _Mississippi" title="Natchez, Mississippi">Natchez</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans, _Louisiana" title="New Orleans, Louisiana" class="mw-redirect">New Orleans</a>, getting assistance from old comrades such as Benjamin Logan and <a href="/wiki/John_Montgomery_(pioneer)" title="John Montgomery (pioneer)">John Montgomery</a>, and winning the tacit support of Kentucky governor <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Shelby" title="Isaac Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>. Clark spent $4, 680 ($58, 931 in 2009 <a href="/wiki/Chained_dollars" title="Chained dollars">chained dollars</a>) of his own money for supplies. In early 1794, however, President Washington issued <a href="/wiki/Proclamation_of_Neutrality" title="Proclamation of Neutrality">a proclamation</a> forbidding Americans from violating U.S. neutrality and threatened to dispatch General <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Wayne" title="Anthony Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Massac" title="Fort Massac">Fort Massac</a> to stop the expedition. The French government recalled GenÃªt and revoked the commissions he granted to the Americans for the war against Spain. Clark's planned campaign gradually collapsed, and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses.
Due to his growing debt, it became impossible for Clark to continue holding his land, since it became subject to seizure. Much of his land he deeded to friends or transferred to family members where it could be held for him, so that it would not be lost to his creditors. After a few years, the lenders and their assigns closed in and deprived the veteran of almost all of the property that remained in his name. Clark, once the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville, where he built a small <a href="/wiki/Gristmill" title="Gristmill">gristmill</a> which he worked with two <a href="/wiki/African_American" title="African American">African American</a> slaves. Clark lived on for another two decades, and continued to struggle with <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">alcohol abuse</a>, a problem which had plagued him on-and-off for many years. He was very bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia, and blamed his misfortune on the state.
The <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Territory" title="Indiana Territory">Indiana Territory</a> chartered the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Canal_Company" title="Indiana Canal Company">Indiana Canal Company</a> in 1805 to build a canal around the <a href="/wiki/Falls_of_the_Ohio" title="Falls of the Ohio" class="mw-redirect">Falls of the Ohio</a>, near Clarksville. Clark was named to the board of directors and was part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal. The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin, when two of the fellow board members, including <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President</a> <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Burr" title="Aaron Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, were arrested for treason. Burr was plotting to seize Louisiana from Spain and open the Mississippi to the Americans. A large part of the company's $1.2&#160; million($60.5 million in 2009 chained dollars) in investments was unaccounted for, and where the funds went was never determined.
In 1809, Clark suffered a severe <a href="/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. Falling into an operating fireplace, he suffered a burn on one leg so severe as to necessitate the amputation of the limb. It was impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill, so he became a dependent member of the household of his brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter at <a href="/wiki/Historic_Locust_Grove" title="Historic Locust Grove">Locust Grove</a> farm eight miles (13&#160; km) from the growing town of Louisville. During 1812, the Virginia General Assembly granted Clark a pension of four hundred dollars per year, and finally recognized his services in the Revolution by granting him a <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">ceremonial sword</a>. After a second stroke, Clark died at Locust Grove, February 13, 1818, and was buried at Locust Grove Cemetery two days later.
In his funeral oration, Judge <a href="/wiki/John_Rowan_(Kentucky)" title="John Rowan (Kentucky)">John Rowan</a> succinctly summed up the stature and importance of George Rogers Clark during the critical years on the Trans-Appalachian frontier: "The mighty oak of the forest has fallen, and now the scrub oaks sprout all around.".
Clark's body was exhumed along with the rest of his family members on October 29, 1869, and reburied at <a href="/wiki/Cave_Hill_Cemetery" title="Cave Hill Cemetery">Cave Hill Cemetery</a> in Louisville.
Several years after Clark's death the state of Virginia granted his estate $30, 000 ($566, 647 in 2009 chained dollars) as a partial payment on the debts that they owed him. The government of Virginia continued to find debt to Clark for decades, with the last payment to his estate being made in 1913. Clark never married and he kept no account of any romantic relationships, although his family held that he had once been in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don <a href="/wiki/Fernando_de_Leyba" title="Fernando de Leyba">Fernando de Leyba</a>, the Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts attest to their belief in Clark's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.
On May 23, 1928, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> ordered a memorial to George Rogers Clark to be erected in Vincennes. Completed in 1933, the George Rogers Clark Memorial, built in Roman <a href="/wiki/Classical_architecture" title="Classical architecture">Classical</a> style, stands on what was then believed to be the site of Fort Sackville, and is now the <a href="/wiki/George_Rogers_Clark_National_Historical_Park" title="George Rogers Clark National Historical Park">George Rogers Clark National Historical Park</a>. It includes a statue of Clark by <a href="/wiki/Hermon_Atkins_MacNeil" title="Hermon Atkins MacNeil">Hermon Atkins MacNeil</a>. On February 25, 1929, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sackville, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service" title="United States Postal Service">U.S. Post Office Department</a> issued a 2-cent <a href="/wiki/Postage_stamp" title="Postage stamp">postage stamp</a> that depicted the surrender. In April 1929, the <a href="/wiki/Paul_Revere" title="Paul Revere">Paul Revere</a> Chapter of the <a href="/wiki/Daughters_of_the_American_Revolution" title="Daughters of the American Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> of <a href="/wiki/Muncie, _Indiana" title="Muncie, Indiana">Muncie, Indiana</a> erected a monument to George Rogers Clark on Washington Avenue in <a href="/wiki/Fredericksburg, _Virginia" title="Fredericksburg, Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>. The marker doesn't identify the connection between General Clark and Fredericksburg, so this choice of location is currently a mystery. In 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_General_Assembly" title="Indiana General Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> designated February 25 George Rogers Clark Day in Indiana. Built in 1929, the <a href="/wiki/George_Rogers_Clark_Memorial_Bridge" title="George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge">George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge</a> (Second Street Bridge) carries <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_31" title="U.S. Highway 31" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Highway 31</a>, over the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> at <a href="/wiki/Louisville, _Kentucky" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>.
