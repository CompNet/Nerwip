Gheorghe Ţiţeica (Romanian pronunciation:&#160; ; 4 October 1873 in <a href="/wiki/Drobeta-Turnu_Severin" title="Drobeta-Turnu Severin">Turnu Severin</a> – 5 February 1939) publishing as George or Georges Tzitzeica) was a <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romanian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> with important contributions in <a href="/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. He is recognized as the founder of the Romanian school of <a href="/wiki/Differential_geometry" title="Differential geometry">differential geometry</a>.
He showed an early interest in science, as well as music and literature. Ţiţeica was an accomplished violinist, having studied music since childhood: music was to remain his hobby. While studying at the <a href="/wiki/Carol_I_High_School" title="Carol I High School" class="mw-redirect">Carol I High School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Craiova" title="Craiova">Craiova</a>, he contributed to the school's magazine, writing the columns on mathematics and studies of literary critique. After graduation he obtained a scholarship at the preparatory school in <a href="/wiki/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, where he also was admitted as a student of the mathematics department of the Faculty of Sciences. In June 1895, he graduated with a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Mathematics" title="Bachelor of Mathematics">Bachelor of Mathematics</a>.
In the summer of 1896, after a stint as a substitute teacher at the Bucharest theological seminary, Ţiţeica passed his exams for promotion to a secondary school position, becoming teacher in <a href="/wiki/Gala%C5%A3i" title="Galaţi" class="mw-redirect">Galaţi</a>.

Ţiţeica was also president of the Mathematical Association of Romania, of the Romanian Association of Science and of the Association of the development and the spreading of science. He was a vice-president of the Polytechnics Association of Romania and member of the High Council of Public Teaching.
Ţiţeica was elected correspondent of the Association of Sciences of <a href="/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge_(city)" title="Liège (city)" class="mw-redirect">Liège</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin_honors" title="Latin honors">doctor honoris causa</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Warsaw" title="University of Warsaw">University of Warsaw</a>. He was the president of the geometry section at the <a href="/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians" title="International Congress of Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a> in <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> (1924), <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" title="Zürich" class="mw-redirect">Zürich</a> (1932), and <a href="/wiki/Oslo" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> (1936).
