<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Nils Gustaf Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> (<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>30 November 1869<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> – <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>9 December 1937<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>) was a <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Swedish<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Nobel Laureate<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> and industrialist, the founder of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA company<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> and inventor of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA cooker <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>and the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Dalén light<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1912<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he was awarded the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Nobel Prize<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> in Physics for his "<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>".
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was born in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Stenstorp<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, a small village in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Falköping Municipality<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Västra Götaland County<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>. He managed the family farm, which he expanded to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1892<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he invented a milk-fat tester to check milk quality of the milk delivered and went to <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Stockholm<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> to show his new invention for <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Gustaf de Laval<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>de Laval<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was impressed by the self-taught <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Chalmers University of Technology<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> where he earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate on leaving in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1896<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was much the same type of inventor as <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Gustaf de Laval<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, not afraid of testing "impossible" ideas, but <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.
In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1906<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> became chief engineer at the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Gas Accumulator Company<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> (manufacturer and distributor of acetylene) and in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1909<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> when <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> was founded, he was appointed the managing director for the company. During his life, <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> was one of the most innovative companies in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Sweden<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and produced a large variety of products that grew every year. Finally in the early <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1970<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>s <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> was forced to reduce the number of markets it was involved in and concentrate on the production of gases for industrial use.
In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1909<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he ascended to the position of Managing Director of the renamed company <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> (<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>). <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> developed lighthouses using <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s products. <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1910<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> the company bought a large real estate in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Lidingö<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and built a production plant that was completed around <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1912<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>, when they moved out from the facilities in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Stockholm<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>.
Initially <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> worked with acetylene (<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>IUPAC<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>: ethyne), an extremely explosive hydrocarbon gas. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> invented <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Agamassan<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> (<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Aga<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.
Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed LPG as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> exploited the new fuel, developing the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Dalén light<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> which incorporated another invention, the 'sun valve'. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.
The '<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Dalen Flasher<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage. This reduced gas consumption by more than 90%. The <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable.
To a rugged coastal area like <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Scandinavia<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA Lighthouses<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> covered the entire <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Panama Canal<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>.
In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1929<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he invented the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>AGA cooker<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>. Most of the testing for the cooker was made in his private kitchen in his <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Villa Ekbacken<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> that was built when <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> moved to <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Lidingö<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1912<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> but that he never actually had a chance to see with his own eyes. His family helped him with the development work, checking temperatures, airflow etc., as the development work proceeded.
His parents were <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Anders<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lovisa Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>. He married <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Elma Persson<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1901<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. They had four children, two daughters and two sons; .
Early in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1912<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was blinded in an acetylene explosion during a test of maximum pressure for the accumultors. Later the same year he was awarded the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Nobel Prize<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> for physics. Too ill to attend the presentation, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> had his brother, ophthalmologist Professor <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Albin Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Caroline Institute<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>, stand in his place.
The presentation speech praised the quality of sacrificing personal safety in scientific experimentation, a compliment that compared <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> with <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Nobel<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> himself. Despite his blindness, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Dalén<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> controlled <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>AGA<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> until his death in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1937<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. He received over 100 patents during his lifetime.
