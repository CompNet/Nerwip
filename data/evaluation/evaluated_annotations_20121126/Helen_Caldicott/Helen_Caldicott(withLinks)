Born in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, Caldicott attended the <a href="/wiki/Fintona_Girls%27_School" title="Fintona Girls' School">Fintona Girls' School</a>, and received her medical degree in 1961 from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Adelaide" title="University of Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> Medical School. In 1977 she joined the staff of the Children's Hospital Medical Center in <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>, and taught <a href="/wiki/Pediatrics" title="Pediatrics">pediatrics</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School" title="Harvard Medical School">Harvard Medical School</a> from 1977 to 1978.
In 1980, following the <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island nuclear accident</a>, she left her medical career in order to concentrate on calling the world's attention to what she refers to as the "insanity" of the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race" title="Nuclear arms race">nuclear arms race</a> and the growing reliance on <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>.
In 1982, she was the subject of the controversial Oscar-winning <a href="/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada" title="National Film Board of Canada">National Film Board of Canada</a> documentary on the dangers of nuclear weapons, entitled <a href="/wiki/If_You_Love_This_Planet" title="If You Love This Planet">If You Love This Planet</a>.
Citing confidential memos, Caldicott says that the <a href="/wiki/Hershey_Foods_Corporation" title="Hershey Foods Corporation" class="mw-redirect">Hershey Foods Corporation</a> was concerned about radiation levels in milk used in their products because of the proximity of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> to Hershey's <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> factory. According to Caldicott, citing a 30 March 1979 study by the Pennsylvania State University, College of Engineering, radiation contaminants that fell on the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> grass found its way into the milk of the local dairy cows. Caldicott noted this was contrary to the findings in the government official report released shortly after the Three Mile Island disaster. Caldicott disputes this report in her book, Nuclear Power is Not the Answer.
Also in 1980, she founded the Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND) in the United States, which was later renamed <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_Action_for_New_Directions" title="Women's Action for New Directions">Women's Action for New Directions</a>.

During her time in the United States from 1977 to 1986, Caldicott was involved with <a href="/wiki/Physicians_for_Social_Responsibility" title="Physicians for Social Responsibility">Physicians for Social Responsibility</a> (founded originally in 1961), an organization of 23, 000 doctors committed to educating others on the dangers of nuclear energy. She also worked abroad to establish similar groups that focused on education about what she said were risks of nuclear energy, nuclear weapons and nuclear war. One such international group (<a href="/wiki/International_Physicians_for_the_Prevention_of_Nuclear_War" title="International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War">International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War</a>) was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1985.

Caldicott's investigative writings were chosen as <a href="/wiki/Project_Censored" title="Project Censored">Project Censored</a>'s #2 story in 1990. Citing the research of <a href="/wiki/Soviet" title="Soviet" class="mw-redirect">Soviet</a> scientists Valery Burdakov and Vyacheslav Filin, Caldicott argued that <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> program was destroying the Earth’s ozone and that 300 total shuttle flights would be enough to "completely destroy the Earth's protective ozone shield, " although there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim.
In 1995 Caldicott returned to the US where she lectured for the <a href="/wiki/New_School_of_Social_Research" title="New School of Social Research" class="mw-redirect">New School of Social Research</a> on the Media, Global Politics, and the Environment.

NPRI seeks to facilitate an ongoing public education campaign in the mainstream media about what it perceives as the dangers of nuclear energy, including weapons and power programs and policies. It is led by both Caldicott and Executive Director Julie R. Enszer. NPRI has attempted to create a consensus to end all uses of nuclear energy by means of public education campaigns, establishing a presence in the mainstream media, and sponsoring high-profile symposia.
In May 2003, Caldicott gave a lecture entitled "The New Nuclear Threat" at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_San_Diego" title="University of San Diego">University of San Diego</a>'s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

Caldicott currently splits her time between the United States and Australia and continues to lecture widely to promote her views on nuclear energy use, including weapons and power.
