Jim Bennett is a Canadian politician. He was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in the 2011 provincial election. He ran in St. Barbe during the 2007 general election but lost to Wallace Young. Bennett previously served as leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador from February 6, 2006 until he resigned from the post just over three months later. This came after many differences in opinion with the Liberal Party caucus. During his time as leader of the Liberal Party he never did gain a seat in the House of Assembly. He was replaced by former interim leader Gerry Reid. Bennett was successful in getting elected to the Daniel's Harbour town council in the September 2009 municipal elections.
In March 2010, Bennett was hired by the town of St. Anthony to help in a legal case over the moving of air ambulance service to Labrador. He filed an injunction to stop the province from moving the air ambulance services but was unsuccessful.
Bennett is a lawyer, and is married to Sandra Pupatello, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and Minister of Economic Development and Trade in the Ontario Liberal Party government of Dalton McGuinty.
Bennett is based in the western Newfoundland coast community of Daniel's Harbour after living a number of years in Windsor, Ontario. While living in Windsor, Bennett twice unsuccessfully sought election to Windsor's city council.
