Kurd Friedrich Rudolf von Mosengeil, also Curd Friedrich Rudolf von Mosengeil (* 7 March 1884 in Bonn; † 5 September 1906 at Wildgall in Rieserfernergruppe), was a <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Physicist" title="Physicist">physicist</a>.
Kurd von Mosengeil was a student of <a href="/wiki/Max_Planck" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a>. In 1905 the latter defended as the first one the theory of <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> of <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. In the subsequent years Planck published several works, in which he explained further conclusions of Einstein's theory. He convinced his assistant <a href="/wiki/Max_von_Laue" title="Max von Laue">Max von Laue</a> and his student Kurd of Mosengeil, as being the first physicists to habilitate as well as to graduate in relativity related subjects.
Through a tragic accident-death of von Mosengeil during a mountain-tour in <a href="/wiki/County_of_Tyrol" title="County of Tyrol">Tyrol</a> in September 1906 he couldn't continue his researches. Planck and <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Wien" title="Wilhelm Wien">Wilhelm Wien</a> shortened the dissertation von Mosengeil's and published it in the <a href="/wiki/Annalen_der_Physik" title="Annalen der Physik">Annalen der Physik</a> in 1907. The paper (Theorie der stationären Strahlung in einem gleichförmig bewegten Hohlraum, en:Theory of stationary radiation in a uniformly moving cavity) contains some relations of <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence" title="Mass-energy equivalence" class="mw-redirect">mass-energy equivalence</a> and was partly related to the work of <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Hasen%C3%B6hrl" title="Friedrich Hasenöhrl">Friedrich Hasenöhrl</a> (1904). He vouched personally for its content and believed in the permanent value of von Mosengeil's examinations. In fact, the dissertation was groundbreaking for further researches which were used by Planck (1907) and Einstein (1908).
