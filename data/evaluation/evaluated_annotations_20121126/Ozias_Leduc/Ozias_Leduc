Ozias Leduc (October 8, 1864 - June 16, 1955) is one of Quebec's early painters. He was born in Saint-Hilaire-de-Rouville. Leduc produced many portraits, still lives and landscapes, as well as religious works.
Leduc was mainly self-taught. Around 1880, he worked with Luigi Cappello, an Italian painter, on church decorations. Around 1881, he was employed at Carli, a manufacturer of statues in Montreal. Around 1883, he worked with Adolphe Rho, decorating another church, this time in Yamachiche. After that, he started working on his own on church decorations. Leduc made a brief trip to Paris and London in 1897 with Suzor-Coté, where he was influenced by some impressionists.
Leduc received an Honorary doctorate from the Université de Montréal in 1938. His legacy includes teaching Paul-Émile Borduas. He is best known for his work decorating the Notre-Dame-de-la-Présentation church in Shawinigan South, a project which took him thirteen years to complete. Notre-Dame-de-la-Présentation church was designated of National Historic Significance of Canada in 2004 and it was plaqued in 2005. Leduc lived a very solitary life in his home town and was dubbed "the sage of St-Hilaire".
He died in Saint-Hyacinthe in 1955.
