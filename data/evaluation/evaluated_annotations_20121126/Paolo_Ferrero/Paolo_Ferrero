Paolo Ferrero (born 17 November 1960 in Pomaretto, Piedmont) is an Italian politician, member of the Communist Refoundation Party and former Italian Minister of Social Solidarity in the Prodi II Cabinet.
Ferrero was born in Pomaretto, in the province of Turin.
A former FIAT worker, he started his political commitment at the age of 17, joining the Proletarian Democracy party. Unlike the majority of his party, Ferrero is religious and is a member of the Waldensian Evangelical Church and was the leader of the youth evangelical Waldensian federation before fully entering politics in 1987. He served as Turin city councillor from 1993 to 1997. He has two children, aged 18 and 12.
Ferrero is relatively new to national politics, as he was first elected as Member of Parliament in 2006. Prior to his appointment, in 2006, to the cabinet of Prodi, he was responsible for the Communist Refoundation Party's social, economic and labour department. He is responsible for social policy, national civil service, non-EU immigrants and drug-related policies.
On 27 July 2008 Ferrero was elected secretary of the Communist Refoundation Party, winning over the other major candidate Nichi Vendola.
