He was trained as an engineer at the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique" title="École Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> (entering class of 1910), served in the French Signal Corps during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, worked on telegraph and radio systems, and in 1926 received a doctorate in mathematics from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" title="University of Paris">Sorbonne</a>, having written a thesis on indefinite <a href="/wiki/Quadratic_forms" title="Quadratic forms" class="mw-redirect">quadratic forms</a> under the supervision of <a href="/wiki/Charles_%C3%89mile_Picard" title="Charles Émile Picard">Charles Émile Picard</a>.
He was a close friend of Dutch physicist <a href="/wiki/Balthasar_van_der_Pol" title="Balthasar van der Pol">Balthasar van der Pol</a>, whose work on nonlinear self-oscillating dynamical systems (see <a href="/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator" title="Van der Pol oscillator">van der Pol oscillator</a>) he extended and popularized among electrical engineers, mathematicians, and economists.
In 1941 he fled the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" title="Battle of France">German occupation</a> of France during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and became a lecturer in electronics at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>. He eventually became a US citizen and a professor of applied physics and general education at Harvard. He returned to Europe in 1968 and lived the rest of his life in the Netherlands.
His intellectual interests were quite varied, spanning various branches of pure and applied mathematics, as well as electronics, acoustics, <a href="/wiki/Control_theory" title="Control theory">control theory</a>, economics, and the history and philosophy of science. At Harvard he had a major influence on the work of economic theorist <a href="/wiki/Richard_M._Goodwin" title="Richard M. Goodwin">Richard M. Goodwin</a>.
