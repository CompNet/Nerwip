He was also an active proponent of Nazi ideology.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Philipp Lénárd<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was born in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Pressburg<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> / <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Pozsony<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Kingdom of Hungary<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>, <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Austrian-Hungarian Empire<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> (since <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1919<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Bratislava<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>, since <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1993<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Slovakia<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>) on <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>July 7, 1862<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>, as the son of a wine merchant. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s parents were <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>German<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>-speakers, and the <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> family had originally come from <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Tyrol<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> in the 17th century. His father <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Philipp von Lenardis<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> (<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1812<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>-<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1896<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>) was a wine-merchant in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Pozsony<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>. His mother was <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Antoine Baumann<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> (<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1831<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>-<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1865<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>). The young <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lénárd<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> learned in <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Hungarian<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> in the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Royal Hungarian Gymnasium<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>, and as he writes it in his autobiography this made a big impression on him (especially the personality of his teacher, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Virgil Klatt<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>). <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> became in his youth an ardent <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Magyar<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> nationalist. His preferred language was <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Hungarian<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> and he objected violently to the use of <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>German<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> place names in the predominantly <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Hungarian<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> province in which he lived. He styled himself <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Fülöp Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, or according to later rumour, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenardi<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1880<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he studied physics and chemistry in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Vienna<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Budapest<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/>. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1882<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he left <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Budapest<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> and returned to <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Pressburg<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> but in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1883<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lénárd<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> moved to <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Heidelberg<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> after his tender for an assistant job in the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>University of Budapest<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> was refused. In <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Heidelberg<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> he studied under the illustrious <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Robert Bunsen<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, interrupted by one semester in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Berlin<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> with <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Hermann von Helmholtz<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, and obtained his doctoral degree in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1886<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1887<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> he worked again in <tag name="LOCATION" value="start"/>Budapest<tag name="LOCATION" value="end"/> under <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Loránd Eötvös<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> as a demonstrator. After posts at <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Aachen<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Bonn<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Breslau<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Heidelberg<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> (<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1896<tag name="DATE" value="end"/><tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1898<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>), and Kiel (<tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1898<tag name="DATE" value="end"/><tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1907<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>), he returned finally to the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>University of Heidelberg<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1907<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> as the head of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Philipp Lenard Institute<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>. In <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1905<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Philip Lénárd<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> became a member of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> and in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1907<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> of the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Hungarian Academy of Sciences<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>.
His early work included studies of phosphorescence and luminescence and the conductivity of flames.
As a physicist, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s major contributions were in the study of cathode rays, which he began in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1888<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive tubes which are partially evacuated glass tubes that have metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage can be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent materials. These windows have come to be known as <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> windows.
Lenard observed that the absorption of the rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>J.J. Thomson<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s work, which ultimately arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them quanta of electricity or for short quanta, after <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Helmholtz<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, while <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>J.J. Thomson<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> proposed the name corpuscles, but eventually electrons has become the everyday term. In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space.
As a result of his <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Crookes<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> tube investigations, he showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observations were that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light.
These latter observations were explained by <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Albert Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, whose wife worked in <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s lab for a time, as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck's constant, h. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was awarded the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Nobel Prize<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> in Physics. Suspicious of the general adulation of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s theories generally; he did not, however, dispute <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s explanation of the photoelectric effect.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> was the first person to study what has been termed the <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> effect in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1892<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.
He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and constructed a novel wind tunnel in which water droplets of various sizes could be held stationary for a few seconds. He was the first to recognize that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped something like a hamburger bun.
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> is remembered today as a strong German<tag name="MISC" value="start"/> <tag name="MISC" value="end"/>nationalist who despised <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>English<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> physics, which he considered as having stolen their ideas from <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Germany<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>. He joined the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>National Socialist Party<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> before it became politically necessary or popular to do so. During the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Nazi<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> regime, he was the outspoken proponent of the idea that <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Germany<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> should rely on "<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Deutsche<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> Physik" and ignore what he considered the fallacious and deliberately misleading ideas of "<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Jewish<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> physics", by which he meant chiefly the theories of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Albert Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, including "the Jewish fraud" of relativity (see also Criticism of relativity theory). An advisor to <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Adolf Hitler<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>, <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> became Chief of <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Aryan physics<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> under the <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Nazis<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/>.
Some measure of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s views on certain scientists may be deduced through examination of <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s book, '<tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Great Men in science, a History of scientific progress<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>', first published in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1933<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. The book was translated into <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>English<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> by Dr H <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Stafford Hatfield<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> with an introduction by the famous scientist Dr <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>E.N. Da C Andrade<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> of <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>University College London<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> and was widely read in schools and universities after the <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>Second World War<tag name="MISC" value="end"/>. The individual scientists selected for inclusion by Lenard do not include <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Einstein<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> or <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Curie<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> and <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Andrade<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> noted that 'A strong individuality like that of the writer of this book is bound to assert strongly individual judgements'. The publisher included what now appears to be an equally remarkable note on page xix of the <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1954<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> <tag name="MISC" value="start"/>English<tag name="MISC" value="end"/> edition: "While Professor <tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/>'s studies of the men of science who preceded him showed not only profound knowledge but also admirable balance, when it came to men of his own time he was apt to let his own strong views on contemporary matters sway his judgement. In his lifetime he would not consent to certain modifications that were proposed in the last study of the series".
<tag name="PERSON" value="start"/>Lenard<tag name="PERSON" value="end"/> retired from <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Heidelberg University<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> as professor of theoretical physics in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1931<tag name="DATE" value="end"/>. He achieved emeritus status there, but he was expelled from his post by <tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="start"/>Allied<tag name="ORGANIZATION" value="end"/> occupation forces in <tag name="DATE" value="start"/>1945<tag name="DATE" value="end"/> when he was 83.
