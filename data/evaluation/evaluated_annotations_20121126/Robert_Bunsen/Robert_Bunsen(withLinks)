Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen (30 March 1811 – 16 August 1899) was a <a href="/wiki/German_people" title="German people" class="mw-redirect">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Chemist" title="Chemist">chemist</a>. He investigated <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectroscopy" title="Electromagnetic spectroscopy" class="mw-redirect">emission spectra</a> of heated elements, and discovered <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> (in 1860) and <a href="/wiki/Rubidium" title="Rubidium">rubidium</a> (in 1861) with <a href="/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff" title="Gustav Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a>. Bunsen developed several gas-analytical methods, was a pioneer in <a href="/wiki/Photochemistry" title="Photochemistry">photochemistry</a>, and did early work in the field of <a href="/wiki/Organoarsenic" title="Organoarsenic" class="mw-redirect">organoarsenic</a> chemistry. With his laboratory assistant, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Desaga" title="Peter Desaga">Peter Desaga</a>, he developed the <a href="/wiki/Bunsen_burner" title="Bunsen burner">Bunsen burner</a>, an improvement on the laboratory burners then in use. The <a href="/wiki/Bunsen%E2%80%93Kirchhoff_Award" title="Bunsen–Kirchhoff Award">Bunsen–Kirchhoff Award</a> for spectroscopy is named after Bunsen and Kirchhoff.
Robert Bunsen was born at <a href="/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen" title="Göttingen">Göttingen</a> in 1811 in what is now the state of <a href="/wiki/Lower_Saxony" title="Lower Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, but was then the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Westphalia" title="Kingdom of Westphalia">Kingdom of Westphalia</a>; upon the defeat of Napoleon three years later it became the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover" title="Kingdom of Hanover">Kingdom of Hanover</a>. Robert was the youngest of four sons of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen" title="University of Göttingen">University of Göttingen</a>'s chief librarian and professor of modern philology, Christian Bunsen (1770–1837). Sources disagree on Robert Bunsen's exact birth date. His <a href="/wiki/Parish_register" title="Parish register">parish register</a>, as well as two <a href="/wiki/Curricula_vitae" title="Curricula vitae" class="mw-redirect">curricula vitae</a>, handwritten by Bunsen himself, support the claim that 30 March 1811 is Bunsen's true birth date; however, many later sources cite 31 March as the date. According to his biographer Georg Lockemann, Bunsen himself celebrated his birthday on the 31st in his later years. Lockemann nevertheless regarded the 30th as the correct date.
After attending school in <a href="/wiki/Holzminden" title="Holzminden">Holzminden</a>, Bunsen matriculated at Göttingen in 1828 and studied chemistry with <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Stromeyer" title="Friedrich Stromeyer">Friedrich Stromeyer</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Mineralogy" title="Mineralogy">mineralogy</a> with <a href="/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Ludwig_Hausmann" title="Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann">Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> with <a href="/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="Carl Friedrich Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>. After obtaining a <a href="/wiki/Ph.D." title="Ph.D." class="mw-redirect">Ph.D.</a> in 1831, Bunsen spent 1832 and 1833 traveling in Germany, France, and Austria; <a href="/wiki/Friedlieb_Ferdinand_Runge" title="Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge">Friedlieb Runge</a> (who discovered <a href="/wiki/Aniline" title="Aniline">aniline</a> and in 1819 isolated <a href="/wiki/Caffeine" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a>), <a href="/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig" title="Justus von Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> in <a href="/wiki/Gie%C3%9Fen" title="Gießen" class="mw-redirect">Gießen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Eilhard_Mitscherlich" title="Eilhard Mitscherlich">Eilhard Mitscherlich</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bonn" title="Bonn">Bonn</a> were among the many scientists he met on his journeys.
In 1833 Bunsen became a lecturer at Göttingen and began experimental studies of the (in)solubility of <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a> salts of <a href="/wiki/Arsenous_acid" title="Arsenous acid">arsenous acid</a>. His discovery of the use of <a href="/wiki/Iron_oxide" title="Iron oxide">iron oxide</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydrate" title="Hydrate">hydrate</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">precipitating agent</a> is still today the most effective <a href="/wiki/Antidote" title="Antidote">antidote</a> against <a href="/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning" title="Arsenic poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a>. In 1836, Bunsen succeeded <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler" title="Friedrich Wöhler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> at the <a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A4t_Kassel" class="extiw" title="de:Universität Kassel">Polytechnic School of Kassel</a>. Bunsen taught there for three years, and then accepted an associate professorship at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Marburg" title="University of Marburg">University of Marburg</a>, where he continued his studies on <a href="/wiki/Cacodyl" title="Cacodyl">cacodyl</a> derivatives. He was promoted to full professorship in 1841.
Bunsen's work brought him quick and wide acclaim, partly because cacodyl, which is extremely toxic and undergoes spontaneous combustion in dry air, is so difficult to work with. Bunsen almost died from <a href="/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning" title="Arsenic poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a>, and an explosion with cacodyl cost him sight in his right eye. In 1841, Bunsen created the <a href="/wiki/Bunsen_cell" title="Bunsen cell">Bunsen cell</a> battery, using a <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> <a href="/wiki/Electrode" title="Electrode">electrode</a> instead of the expensive platinum electrode used in <a href="/wiki/William_Robert_Grove" title="William Robert Grove">William Robert Grove</a>'s electrochemical cell. Early in 1851 he accepted a professorship at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wroc%C5%82aw" title="University of Wrocław">University of Breslau</a>, where he taught for three semesters.
In late 1852 Bunsen became the successor of <a href="/wiki/Leopold_Gmelin" title="Leopold Gmelin">Leopold Gmelin</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Heidelberg" title="University of Heidelberg" class="mw-redirect">University of Heidelberg</a>. There he used <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> to produce pure <a href="/wiki/Metals" title="Metals" class="mw-redirect">metals</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barium" title="Barium">barium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lithium" title="Lithium">lithium</a>. A long collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Henry_Enfield_Roscoe" title="Henry Enfield Roscoe">Henry Enfield Roscoe</a> began in 1852, in which they studied the photochemical formation of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride" title="Hydrogen chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> from <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>. He discontinued his work with Roscoe in 1859 and joined <a href="/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff" title="Gustav Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> to study emission spectra of heated elements, a research area called <a href="/wiki/Spectrum_analysis" title="Spectrum analysis">spectrum analysis</a>. For this work, Bunsen and his laboratory assistant, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Desaga" title="Peter Desaga">Peter Desaga</a>, had perfected a special gas burner by 1855, influenced by earlier models. The newer design of Bunsen and Desaga, which provided a very hot and clean flame, is now called simply the "<a href="/wiki/Bunsen_burner" title="Bunsen burner">Bunsen burner</a>".
There had been earlier studies of the characteristic colors of heated elements, but nothing systematic. In the summer of 1859, Kirchhoff suggested to Bunsen that he try to form prismatic spectra of these colors. By October of that year the two scientists had invented an appropriate instrument, a prototype spectroscope. Using it, they were able to identify the characteristic spectra of sodium, lithium, and potassium. After numerous laborious purifications, Bunsen proved that highly pure samples gave unique spectra. In the course of this work, Bunsen detected previously unknown new blue spectral emission lines in samples of mineral water from <a href="/wiki/D%C3%BCrkheim" title="Dürkheim" class="mw-redirect">Dürkheim</a>. He guessed that these lines indicated the existence of an undiscovered chemical element. After careful distillation of forty tons of this water, in the spring of 1860 he was able to isolate 17&#160; grams of a new element. He named the element "<a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a>", after the Latin word for deep blue. The following year he discovered rubidium, by a similar process.
In 1860, Bunsen was elected a foreign member of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>.
Bunsen was one of the most universally admired scientists of his generation. He was a master teacher, devoted to his students, and they were equally devoted to him. At a time of vigorous and often caustic scientific debates, Bunsen always conducted himself as a perfect gentleman, maintaining his distance from theoretical disputes. He much preferred to work quietly in his laboratory, continuing to enrich his science with useful discoveries. As a matter of principle he never took out a patent. He never married.
When Bunsen retired at the age of 78, he shifted his work solely to <a href="/wiki/Geology" title="Geology">geology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mineralogy" title="Mineralogy">mineralogy</a>, an interest which he had pursued throughout his career. He died in <a href="/wiki/Heidelberg" title="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, aged 88.
