Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (; German: ; 12 August 1887&#160; – 4 January 1961) was an <a href="/wiki/Austrians" title="Austrians">Austrian</a> <a href="/wiki/Physicist" title="Physicist">physicist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_biologist" title="Theoretical biologist" class="mw-redirect">theoretical biologist</a> who was one of the fathers of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, and is famed for a number of important contributions to physics, especially the <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schrödinger equation">Schrödinger equation</a>, for which he received the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1933. In 1935 he proposed the <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> <a href="/wiki/Thought_experiment" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a>.
In 1887 Schrödinger was born in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Austria to Rudolf Schrödinger (cerecloth producer, botanist) and Georgine Emilia Brenda (daughter of Alexander Bauer, Professor of Chemistry, <a href="/wiki/K.u.k." title="K.u.k." class="mw-redirect">k.u.k.</a> <a href="/wiki/Vienna_University_of_Technology" title="Vienna University of Technology">Technische Hochschule Vienna</a>).
His mother was half Austrian and half English; the English side of her family came from <a href="/wiki/Leamington_Spa" title="Leamington Spa" class="mw-redirect">Leamington Spa</a>. Schrödinger learned English and German almost at the same time because both were spoken in the family household. His father was a <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic</a> and his mother was a <a href="/wiki/Lutheran" title="Lutheran" class="mw-redirect">Lutheran</a>.
In 1898 he attended the <a href="/wiki/Akademisches_Gymnasium" title="Akademisches Gymnasium" class="mw-redirect">Akademisches Gymnasium</a>. Between 1906 and 1910 Schrödinger studied in Vienna under <a href="/wiki/Franz_S._Exner" title="Franz S. Exner">Franz Serafin Exner</a> (1849–1926) and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Hasen%C3%B6hrl" title="Friedrich Hasenöhrl">Friedrich Hasenöhrl</a> (1874–1915). He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich ("Fritz") Kohlrausch (1884–1953). In 1911 Schrödinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schrödinger was strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" title="Arthur Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in color theory, philosophy, perception, and eastern religion, especially <a href="/wiki/Hindu" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="/wiki/Vedanta" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>.
In 1914 Erwin Schrödinger achieved <a href="/wiki/Habilitation" title="Habilitation">Habilitation</a> (venia legendi). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (<a href="/wiki/Gorizia" title="Gorizia">Gorizia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duino" title="Duino">Duino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sistiana" title="Sistiana">Sistiana</a>, Prosecco, Vienna). On 6 April 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie Bertel. The same year, he became the assistant to <a href="/wiki/Max_Wien" title="Max Wien">Max Wien</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Jena" title="Jena">Jena</a>, and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (Ausserordentlicher Professor), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (Ordentlicher Professor, i.e. full professor), in <a href="/wiki/Breslau_University" title="Breslau University" class="mw-redirect">Breslau</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw" title="Wrocław">Wrocław</a>, Poland).
In 1921, he moved to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Zurich" title="University of Zurich">University of Zürich</a>. In January 1926, Schrödinger published in <a href="/wiki/Annalen_der_Physik" title="Annalen der Physik">Annalen der Physik</a> the paper "Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem" [tr. Quantization as an <a href="/wiki/Eigenvalue" title="Eigenvalue" class="mw-redirect">Eigenvalue</a> Problem] on wave mechanics and what is now known as the <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schrödinger equation">Schrödinger equation</a>. In this paper he gave a "derivation" of the wave equation for time independent systems, and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen-like_atom" title="Hydrogen-like atom">hydrogen-like atom</a>. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century, and created a revolution in quantum mechanics, and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the <a href="/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator" title="Quantum harmonic oscillator">quantum harmonic oscillator</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rigid_rotor" title="Rigid rotor">rigid rotor</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Diatomic_molecule" title="Diatomic molecule">diatomic molecule</a>, and gives a new derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper in May showed the equivalence of his approach to that of <a href="/wiki/Heisenberg" title="Heisenberg" class="mw-redirect">Heisenberg</a> and gave the treatment of the <a href="/wiki/Stark_effect" title="Stark effect">Stark effect</a>. A fourth paper in this most remarkable series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in <a href="/wiki/Scattering" title="Scattering">scattering</a> problems. These papers were the central achievement of his career and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.
In 1927, he succeeded <a href="/wiki/Max_Planck" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin" title="Humboldt University of Berlin">Friedrich Wilhelm University</a> in Berlin. In 1933, however, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis' <a href="/wiki/Anti-semitism" title="Anti-semitism" class="mw-redirect">anti-semitism</a>. He became a Fellow of <a href="/wiki/Magdalen_College, _Oxford" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">Magdalen College</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. Soon after he arrived, he received the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> together with <a href="/wiki/Paul_Dirac" title="Paul Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>. His position at Oxford did not work out; his unconventional personal life (Schrödinger lived with two women) was not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have posed a problem. He had the prospect of a position at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Graz" title="University of Graz">University of Graz</a> in Austria in 1936.
In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, he proposed what is now called the <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> <a href="/wiki/Thought_experiment" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a>.
In 1939, after the <a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>, Schrödinger had problems because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>. He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so, and he personally apologized to <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein</a>). However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the university dismissed him from his job for political unreliability. He suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to Italy. From there he went to visiting positions in <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ghent_University" title="Ghent University">Ghent</a> Universities.
In 1940 he received a personal invitation from Ireland's <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera" title="Éamon de Valera">Éamon de Valera</a> to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an <a href="/wiki/Dublin_Institute_for_Advanced_Studies" title="Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies">Institute for Advanced Studies</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. He moved to <a href="/wiki/Clontarf, _Dublin" title="Clontarf, Dublin">Clontarf, Dublin</a> and became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics and remained there for 17 years, during which time he became a naturalized Irish citizen. He wrote about 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of <a href="/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories" title="Classical unified field theories">unified field theory</a>.
In 1944, he wrote <a href="/wiki/What_is_Life%3F" title="What is Life?" class="mw-redirect">What is Life?</a>, which contains a discussion of <a href="/wiki/Negentropy" title="Negentropy">negentropy</a> and the concept of a complex <a href="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecule</a> with the genetic code for living <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/James_D._Watson" title="James D. Watson">James D. Watson</a>'s memoir, <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>, the Secret of Life, Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a>, which led to the discovery of the <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="/wiki/Double_helix" title="Double helix" class="mw-redirect">double helix</a> structure. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Francis_Crick" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a>, in his autobiographical book What Mad Pursuit, described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules. However, the geneticist and 1946 Nobel-prize winner <a href="/wiki/H.J._Muller" title="H.J. Muller" class="mw-redirect">H.J. Muller</a> had in his 1922 article "Variation due to Change in the Individual Gene" already laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schrödinger derives from first principles in What is Life?, properties which Muller refined in his 1929 article "The Gene As The Basis of Life" and further clarified during the 1930s, long before the publication of What is Life?.
Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. During this time he remained committed to his particular passion; involvements with students occurred and he fathered two children by two different Irish women. He had a life-long interest in the <a href="/wiki/Vedanta" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, which influenced his speculations at the close of What is Life? about the possibility that individual <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a> is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a>.
In 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ad personam). At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of wave-particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone causing much controversy.
Schrödinger suffered from <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in <a href="/wiki/Arosa" title="Arosa">Arosa</a>. It was there that he discovered his wave equation.
Schrödinger decided in 1933 that he could not live in a country in which persecution of <a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew" class="mw-redirect">Jews</a> had become a national policy. <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Lindemann, _1st_Viscount_Cherwell" title="Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell">Alexander Frederick Lindemann</a>, the head of physics at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford University</a>, visited Germany in the spring of 1933 to try to arrange positions in England for some young Jewish scientists from Germany. He spoke to Schrödinger about posts for one of his assistants and was surprised to discover that Schrödinger himself was interested in leaving Germany. Schrödinger asked for a colleague, Arthur March, to be offered a post as his assistant.
The request for March stemmed from Schrödinger's unconventional relationships with women: although his relations with his wife Anny were good, he had had many lovers with his wife's full knowledge (and in fact, Anny had her own lover, <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Weyl" title="Hermann Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>). Schrödinger asked for March to be his assistant because, at that time, he was in love with March's wife Hilde.
Many of the scientists who had left Germany spent mid-1933 in the Italian province of <a href="/wiki/South_Tyrol" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>. Here Hilde became pregnant with Schrödinger's child. On 4 November 1933 Schrödinger, his wife and Hilde March arrived in Oxford. Schrödinger had been elected a fellow of <a href="/wiki/Magdalen_College, _Oxford" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">Magdalen College</a>. Soon after they arrived in Oxford, Schrödinger heard that, for his work on <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schrödinger equation">wave mechanics</a>, he had been awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_prize" title="Nobel prize" class="mw-redirect">Nobel prize</a>.
In early 1934 Schrödinger was invited to lecture at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> and while there he was made an offer of a permanent position. On his return to Oxford he negotiated about salary and pension conditions at Princeton but in the end he did not accept. It is thought that the fact that he wished to live at Princeton with Anny and Hilde both sharing the upbringing of his child was not found acceptable. The fact that Schrödinger openly had two wives, even if one of them was married to another man, was not well received in Oxford either. Nevertheless, his daughter Ruth Georgie Erica was born there on 30 May 1934.
On 4 January 1961, Schrödinger died in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> at the age of 73 of tuberculosis. He left a widow, Anny (born Annemarie Bertel on 3 December 1896, died 3 October 1965), and was buried in <a href="/wiki/Alpbach" title="Alpbach">Alpbach</a>, Austria.
The philosophical issues raised by <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> are still debated today and remains his most enduring legacy in <a href="/wiki/Popular_science" title="Popular science">popular science</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_equation" title="Schrödinger's equation" class="mw-redirect">Schrödinger's equation</a> is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. The huge crater <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_(crater)" title="Schrödinger (crater)">Schrödinger</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/Far_side_(Moon)" title="Far side (Moon)" class="mw-redirect">far side of the Moon</a>, is named after him. The <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger_International_Institute_for_Mathematical_Physics" title="Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics">Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics</a> was established in Vienna in 1993.
One of Schrödinger's lesser-known areas of scientific contribution was his work on <a href="/wiki/Color" title="Color">color</a>, <a href="/wiki/Color_perception" title="Color perception" class="mw-redirect">color perception</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Colorimetry" title="Colorimetry">colorimetry</a> (Farbenmetrik). In 1920, he published three papers in this area:.
The second of these is available in English as "Outline of a Theory of Color Measurement for Daylight Vision" in Sources of Color Science, Ed. David L. MacAdam, The MIT Press (1970), 134-182.
