Séamus Brennan was born in <a href="/wiki/Galway" title="Galway">Galway</a>. He was educated at <a href="/wiki/The_Bish" title="The Bish">St. Joseph's Secondary School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galway" title="Galway">Galway</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_College_Galway" title="University College Galway" class="mw-redirect">University College Galway</a> and <a href="/wiki/University_College_Dublin" title="University College Dublin">University College Dublin</a> where he studied Economics and Commerce and qualified as an accountant.

In 1973 he succeeded Tommy Mullins as General Secretary of Fianna Fáil. He began to revamp the party structure with the setting up of a national executive. Brennan studied and was impressed by the Presidential Election in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> in 1976. He applied new techniques such as marketing strategies and opinion polls to the <a href="/wiki/Irish_general_election, _1977" title="Irish general election, 1977">1977 general election</a>. This resulted in the biggest ever parliamentary majority for any party. Fianna Fáil and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Lynch" title="Jack Lynch">Jack Lynch</a> were back in power with a 20-seat majority. Brennan was appointed to <a href="/wiki/Seanad_%C3%89ireann" title="Seanad Éireann">Seanad Éireann</a>.
In 1979 Brennan supported <a href="/wiki/George_Colley" title="George Colley">George Colley</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_leadership_election, _1979" title="Fianna Fáil leadership election, 1979">Fianna Fáil leadership contest</a>, caused by the retirement of <a href="/wiki/Jack_Lynch" title="Jack Lynch">Jack Lynch</a>.

He supported Colley, and later <a href="/wiki/Desmond_O%27Malley" title="Desmond O'Malley">Desmond O'Malley</a>, in various leadership heaves throughout the whole era.
