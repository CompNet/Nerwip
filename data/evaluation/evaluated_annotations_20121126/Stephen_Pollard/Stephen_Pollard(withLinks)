Formerly a journalist and leader-writer on the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a>, Stephen Pollard left that paper in 2001 soon after it was taken over by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Desmond" title="Richard Desmond">Richard Desmond</a>, a publisher of pornographic magazines, who began implementing radical cutbacks. Pollard's last leader for the paper, on the problems of the British farming industry, turned out to contain the words "Fuck you, Desmond" spelt out with the first letter of each sentence. A standing job offer at <a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a> was withdrawn as they considered the <a href="/wiki/Acrostic" title="Acrostic">acrostic</a> in the article to be "unacceptable" and "insulting".
After early articles for the Fabian Review in 1993 (e.g. "More Southern Discomfort", discussing ways by which the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> could reform itself sufficiently to regain power), Stephen Pollard's career has seen a fair degree of political movement from Left to Right; he was formerly an advisor to anti-EU Labour politician <a href="/wiki/Peter_Shore" title="Peter Shore">Peter Shore</a>.
Pollard was one of the signatory founders, in 2005, of the <a href="/wiki/Henry_Jackson_Society" title="Henry Jackson Society">Henry Jackson Society</a>, which advocates a proactive approach to the spread of <a href="/wiki/Liberal_democracy" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> across the world.
By 2006, Pollard held the view that, in the "battle to save western civilisation", the "Left, in any recognisable form, is now the enemy". His biography of Labour Party politician <a href="/wiki/David_Blunkett" title="David Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>, with the subject's involvement, was published in 2004.
In November 2008, Pollard became editor of <a href="/wiki/The_Jewish_Chronicle" title="The Jewish Chronicle">The Jewish Chronicle</a>. In his 2009 <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a> review of a book by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Bawer" title="Bruce Bawer">Bruce Bawer</a>, Pollard endorsed the notion that "liberal appeasement" is paving the way for a "replacement" of European civilization by radical Islamist ideology. Pollard has argued that the <a href="/wiki/Palestine_Solidarity_Campaign" title="Palestine Solidarity Campaign">Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a> has tipped over to antisemitism and the defence of attacks on Jews. Writing about the disruption of an appearance by the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="Israel Philharmonic Orchestra">Israel Philharmonic Orchestra</a> on 1 September 2011 at the <a href="/wiki/The_Proms" title="The Proms">BBC Proms</a> he asserted that the actions of pro-Palestinian activists had a "chilling air" reminiscent of "the way Nazi party members broke up meetings" in Weimar Germany.
