Wolfgang Döblin, known in France as Vincent Doblin, (17 March 1915 – 21 June 1940) was a <a href="/wiki/Germans" title="Germans">German</a>-<a href="/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a>.
Wolfgang was the son of the Jewish-German novelist, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_D%C3%B6blin" title="Alfred Döblin">Alfred Döblin</a>. His family escaped from <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> to France where he became a citizen. Studying <a href="/wiki/Probability_theory" title="Probability theory">probability theory</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Institute_Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Institute Henri Poincaré" class="mw-redirect">Institute Henri Poincaré</a> under <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Ren%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A9chet" title="Maurice René Fréchet">Fréchet</a>, he quickly made a name for himself as a gifted theorist. He became a doctor at age 23. Drafted in November 1938, after refusing to be exempted of military service, he had to stay in the active Army when World War II broke out in 1939, and was quartered at Givet, in the Ardennes, as a telephone operator. There, he wrote down his latest work on the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, and sent this as a "pli cacheté" (sealed envelope) to the French Academy of Sciences. His company, sent to the sector of the Saare on the ligne Maginot in April 1940, was caught in the German attack in the Ardennes in May, withdrew to the Vosges, and capitulated on June 22, 1940. On June 21, Doeblin had committed suicide in Housseras (a small village near to Epinal), at the moment where German troops came in sight of the place. The sealed envelope remained unopened till 2000.
The envelope was opened in 2000, revealing that Döblin was ahead of his time in the development of the theory of <a href="/wiki/Markov_process" title="Markov process">Markov processes</a>. In recognition of his results, <a href="/wiki/It%C5%8D%27s_lemma" title="Itō's lemma">Itō's lemma</a> is now referred to as the <a href="/wiki/It%C5%8D%E2%80%93Doeblin_Theorem" title="Itō–Doeblin Theorem" class="mw-redirect">Itō–Doeblin Theorem</a>.
His life was recently the subject of a movie by Agnes Handwerk and Harrie Willems, A Mathematician Rediscovered.
