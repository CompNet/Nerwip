But not as homosexuals.” Additionally, he feared the parade would promote a "homosexual lifestyle" and complained that police did not use enough force in breaking it up by stating “Why was force not used to break up an illegal demonstration?”. Kaczynski referred to the organizers of the gay pride parades as "perverts". In 2004 his opponents called his actions <a href="/wiki/Constitutionality" title="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a> and he was repeatedly criticised by the <a href="/wiki/Mazowieckie_Voivodeship" title="Mazowieckie Voivodeship" class="mw-redirect">Mazowieckie Voivodeship</a> administration, which officially supervises the Mayor of Warsaw.

In his first public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his presidency would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of "purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime (...), particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain unjust enrichment, a rush that is poisoning society, [and preventing the state from ensuring] elementary social security, health security, basic conditions for the development of the family [and] the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.
During his inauguration he stated several goals he would pursue during his presidency. Among those concerning internal affairs were: increasing social solidarity in Poland, bringing justice to those who were responsible for, or were affected by communist crimes in the People's Republic of Poland, fighting corruption, providing security in economy, and safety for development of family. Kaczyński also stated that he would seek to abolish economic inequalities between various regions of Poland. In his speech he also emphasized combining modernisation with tradition and remembering the teachings of Pope John Paul II.

Strengthening ties with the United States while continuing to develop relations within the European Union are two main goals of <a href="/wiki/Polish_foreign_affairs" title="Polish foreign affairs" class="mw-redirect">Polish foreign affairs</a>, as well as improving relations with France and Germany despite several problems in relations with the latter. Aside from those issues, his immediate goals were to develop tangible strategic partnership with <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and greater cooperation with the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_states" title="Baltic states">Baltic states</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>.

In November 2006 in <a href="/wiki/Helsinki" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, at a European Union—Russia meeting, Poland vetoed the launch of EU-Russia partnership talks due to a Russian ban on Polish meat and plant products imports.
As a reaction to claims by a German exile group <a href="/wiki/Preussische_Treuhand" title="Preussische Treuhand" class="mw-redirect">Preussische Treuhand</a>, which represents post-1945 <a href="/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II" title="Expulsion of Germans after World War II" class="mw-redirect">German expellees from Eastern Europe</a>, the Polish Foreign Minister Fotyga mistakenly threatened to reopen a 1990 Treaty fixing the Oder and Neisse rivers as the border between the two countries instead of the Neighborhood Treaty signed in the same year.
Following the military conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Kaczyński provided the website of the President of Poland for dissemination of information for blocked by the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Federation" title="Russian Federation" class="mw-redirect">Russian Federation</a> Georgian internet portals.
