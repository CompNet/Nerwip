Philippe François Marie, comte de Hauteclocque, then Leclerc de Hauteclocque, by a 1945 decree that incorporated his <a href="/wiki/French_Resistance" title="French Resistance">French Resistance</a> <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">alias</a> Jacques-Philippe Leclerc to his name, (French pronunciation:&#160; ; 22 November 1902 – 28 November 1947), was a <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> general during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. He became <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_France" title="Marshal of France">Marshal of France</a> posthumously, in 1952 and is known in France simply as le maréchal Leclerc.
Philippe François Marie de Hauteclocque was born on 22 November 1902 at <a href="/wiki/Belloy-Saint-L%C3%A9onard" title="Belloy-Saint-Léonard">Belloy-Saint-Léonard</a> in the department of <a href="/wiki/Somme" title="Somme">Somme</a>. He was the fifth of six children of Adrien de Hauteclocque, comte de Hauteclocque (1864–1945) and Marie-Thérèse van der Cruisse de Waziers (1870–1956). Philippe was named in honour of an ancestor killed by Croats in 1635.
Leclerc came from an old line of country nobility; his direct ancestors had served in the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Crusade" title="Fifth Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a> against Egypt, and again in the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Crusade" title="Eighth Crusade">Eighth Crusade</a> of <a href="/wiki/Louis_IX_of_France" title="Louis IX of France">Saint Louis</a> against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Omer" title="Battle of Saint-Omer">Battle of Saint-Omer</a> in 1340 and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fontenoy" title="Battle of Fontenoy">Battle of Fontenoy</a> in 1745. The family managed to survive the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Three members of the family served in <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" title="Napoleon I of France" class="mw-redirect">Napoleon's</a> <a href="/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e" title="Grande Armée">Grande Armée</a> and a fourth, who suffered from weak health, in the supply train. The youngest of these had a son, who became a noted <a href="/wiki/Egyptology" title="Egyptology">egyptologist</a>; he, in turn, had three sons. The first and third became officers in the French Army; serving during the colonial campaigns before both were killed during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The second son was Leclerc’s father; he also served in World War I, but survived the conflict and inherited the family estate in Belloy-Saint-Léonard.
Philippe attended the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_sp%C3%A9ciale_militaire_de_Saint-Cyr" title="École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr">École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr</a>, the French military academy, graduating in 1924, and entered the <a href="/wiki/French_Army" title="French Army">French Army</a>; he attained the rank of <a href="/wiki/Captain_(land)" title="Captain (land)" class="mw-redirect">captain</a> in 1937.
During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, he joined the <a href="/wiki/Free_French" title="Free French" class="mw-redirect">Free French</a> forces after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" title="Battle of France">fall of France</a> in June 1940, and made his way to London. <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> upon meeting him promoted him from Captain to Major (commandant) and ordered him to <a href="/wiki/French_Equatorial_Africa" title="French Equatorial Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a> as <a href="/wiki/List_of_colonial_heads_of_French_Cameroon" title="List of colonial heads of French Cameroon" class="mw-redirect">governor of French Cameroon</a> from 29 August 1940 to 12 November 1940. He commanded the column which attacked the <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers" title="Axis Powers" class="mw-redirect">Axis</a> forces from <a href="/wiki/Chad" title="Chad">Chad</a>, and, having marched his troops across West Africa, distinguished himself in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.
After landing in <a href="/wiki/Normandy" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> on 1 August 1944, his <a href="/wiki/2nd_Armored_Division_(France)" title="2nd Armored Division (France)">2nd Armored Division</a> participated in the <a href="/wiki/Falaise_Pocket" title="Falaise Pocket" class="mw-redirect">battle of the Falaise Pocket</a> (12 to 21 August), and went on to <a href="/wiki/Liberation_of_Paris" title="Liberation of Paris">liberate Paris</a>. Allied troops were avoiding Paris, moving around it clockwise towards Germany. Leclerc and de Gaulle had to persuade Eisenhower to send troops help the Parisians, who had risen against the Germans. In The Other Side of Time, Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division had been part of Patton's Third Army, and when they entered Paris, many had not been informed of the change of command and told the Parisians that they were part of the Third Army.
In Cointet, Jean-Paul, Paris 40-44, Perrin 2001, <a href="/wiki/Special:BookSources/2262015163" class="internal mw-magiclink-isbn">ISBN 2-262-01516-3</a>, Sixième Partie, chapitre 3, the author notes that the Allies originally planned to bypass Paris and places the uprising and the liberation by Leclerc in the context of the political struggle for leadership in post-liberation France, both being aimed at cementing de Gaulle's claim.

At the <a href="/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe" title="End of World War II in Europe">end of World War II in Europe</a>, he received command of the <a href="/wiki/French_Far_East_Expeditionary_Corps" title="French Far East Expeditionary Corps">French Far East Expeditionary Corps</a> (Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient, CEFEO), and represented France during the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender" title="Japanese Instrument of Surrender">surrender of the Japanese Empire</a> on 2 September 1945; previously, in May 1945, he had been appointed a member of the <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur" title="Légion d'honneur" class="mw-redirect">Légion d'honneur</a>, and the same year legally <a href="/wiki/Name_change" title="Name change">changed his name</a> to Jacques-Philippe Leclerc de Hautecloque, incorporating his French Resistance pseudonym.
As new CEFEO commander, Leclerc set forth in October 1945 in <a href="/wiki/French_Indochina" title="French Indochina">French Indochina</a>, first cracking a <a href="/wiki/Vietminh" title="Vietminh" class="mw-redirect">Vietminh</a> blockade around <a href="/wiki/Saigon" title="Saigon" class="mw-redirect">Saigon</a>, then driving through the <a href="/wiki/Mekong" title="Mekong">Mekong</a> delta and up into the highlands.
<a href="/wiki/Jean_Sainteny" title="Jean Sainteny">Jean Sainteny</a> flew to Saigon to consult Leclerc, then acting as high commissioner, who approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Vietnam. <a href="/wiki/Admiral_d%27Argenlieu" title="Admiral d'Argenlieu" class="mw-redirect">Admiral d'Argenlieu</a> bluntly denounced Leclerc: "I am amazed - yes, that is the word, amazed - that France's fine expeditionary corps in <a href="/wiki/Indochina" title="Indochina">Indochina</a> is commanded by officers who would rather negotiate than fight".
The negotiations did not work. General Leclerc, returned to Paris from Vietnam, now warned that "anti-communism will be a useless tool unless the problem of nationalism is resolved." But his wisdom was ignored. The French Communists, after breaking with <a href="/wiki/Paul_Ramadier" title="Paul Ramadier">Paul Ramadier</a>, triggered a series of strikes and other disorders that plunged France into civil strife. Leclerc was later replaced by <a href="/wiki/Jean-%C3%89tienne_Valluy" title="Jean-Étienne Valluy">Jean-Étienne Valluy</a>.
Jacques-Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque died in 1947 in an airplane accident near <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9char" title="Béchar">Colomb-Béchar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, and was awarded the honour of <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_France" title="Marshal of France">Marshal of France</a> posthumously in 1952.

There is a monument to Leclerc at coordinates , in the <a href="/wiki/Petit-Montrouge" title="Petit-Montrouge">Petit-Montrouge</a> quarter of the <a href="/wiki/XIVe_arrondissement" title="XIVe arrondissement" class="mw-redirect">14th arrondissement</a> in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, between Avenue de la Porte d'Orléans and Rue de la Légion Étrangère. The monument is near the Square du Serment-de-Koufra.
