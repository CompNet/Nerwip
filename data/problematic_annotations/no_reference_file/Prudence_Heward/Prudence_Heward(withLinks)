However, it was still an era when women artists were given little credibility and it wasn't until 1932 that Heward's first solo exhibition came at the Scott Gallery in Montréal.
Wanting to refine her skills, and drawn to the great gathering of creative genius in the <a href="/wiki/Montparnasse_Quarter" title="Montparnasse Quarter" class="mw-redirect">Montparnasse Quarter</a> of <a href="/wiki/Paris, _France" title="Paris, France" class="mw-redirect">Paris, France</a>, between 1925 and 1926 Prudence Heward lived and painted in Paris.
