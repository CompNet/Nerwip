This 1963 painting is perhaps his best-known work.
This 1954 work was inspired by two lines from the poet <a href="/wiki/Roy_Campbell_(Poet)" title="Roy Campbell (Poet)" class="mw-redirect">Roy Campbell</a>:.
"Horse and Train" is a part of the <a href="/wiki/Art_Gallery_of_Hamilton" title="Art Gallery of Hamilton">Art Gallery of Hamilton</a>'s permanent collection; Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Dofasco Inc) donated the painting in 1957. It appears on the cover of the album <a href="/wiki/Night_Vision_(Bruce_Cockburn_album)" title="Night Vision (Bruce Cockburn album)">Night Vision</a> by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Cockburn" title="Bruce Cockburn">Bruce Cockburn</a>. Alex Colville and "Horse and Train" are mentioned in the introduction (and in the story itself) of Nova Scotia fiction writer Barry Wood's short story Nowhere to Go published in England's <a href="/wiki/Postscripts" title="Postscripts">Postscripts</a> #14 in 2008.
His mural in Tweedie Hall at <a href="/wiki/Mount_Allison_University" title="Mount Allison University">Mount Allison University</a>, known officially as "The History of Mount Allison" or "The Circuit Rider, " features a centrepiece of a large rear end of a horse. This "horse's ass painting, " as it is often known, is viewed by some as brilliant and by some as appalling. Colville chose not to explain the significance of the work.
His 1967 painting "Pacific", showing a man leaning against an open door looking out to sea while a pistol rests on a table in the foreground, inspired one of the definitive scenes in the 1995 film <a href="/wiki/Heat_(1995_film)" title="Heat (1995 film)">Heat</a> with actor Robert De Niro.
Painted in 1953, its sale at auction for $1.287 million set a record for a work by a living Canadian artist. Part of the estate of the late G. Hamilton Southam (1918-2008), it was sold at an auction of Canadian post-war and contemporary art by Heffel Fine Art Auction House on November 25, 2010. Expected to get up to $600, 000, the price inflated during a three-way bidding war between two Canadian phone bidders and a person at the auction.
Colville designed the images on the Canadian 1867-1967 centennial commemorative coin set. The set consists of the following designs: <a href="/wiki/Rock_dove" title="Rock dove" class="mw-redirect">Rock dove</a> on <a href="/wiki/Penny_(Canadian_coin)" title="Penny (Canadian coin)">1 cent coin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a> on <a href="/wiki/Nickel_(Canadian_coin)" title="Nickel (Canadian coin)">5 cent coin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mackerel" title="Mackerel">mackerel</a> on <a href="/wiki/Dime_(Canadian_coin)" title="Dime (Canadian coin)">10 cent coin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lynx" title="Lynx">lynx</a> on <a href="/wiki/Quarter_(Canadian_coin)" title="Quarter (Canadian coin)">25 cent coin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wolf" title="Wolf" class="mw-redirect">wolf</a> on <a href="/wiki/50_cent_piece_(Canadian_coin)" title="50 cent piece (Canadian coin)" class="mw-redirect">50 cent coin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_silver_dollar" title="Canadian silver dollar">1 dollar coin</a>.
