Life and career.
Poher was born in <a href="/wiki/Ablon-sur-Seine">Ablon-sur-Seine</a>, Val-de-Marne.
He graduated from the <a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand">Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Saint-Louis">Lycée Saint-Louis</a> in Paris and later studied law. On 19 August 1938 he married Henriette Tugler, with whom he had one daughter, Marie-Agnès.
His political career began in 1938, when he became a junior executive officer in the Ministry of Finance.
Later he served on several positions before entering Senate: Chairman, Ministry of Finance Liberation Committee (from 20 July 1944); Head of Social Services, Ministry of Finance (from 1 January 1945); Mayor of Ablon-sur-Seine (from 1 January 1946); Sec. of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (Govt. of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Schuman">Robert Schuman</a>); Sec. of State for the Budget (Govt. of <a href="/wiki/Henri_Queuille">Henri Queuille</a>).
A longtime ally and political protégé of Schumann, Poher was elected to the Senate in 1952, where he remained for over 40 years (until 1995). As Senator he continued to serve in some governments and his home town mayor. Like Schuman, he was known for strongly pro-European integration positions, having served as <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Parliament">President of the European Parliament</a> (1968–1969).
Interim Presidency of the Republic.
According to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_succession">order of succession</a> established by the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_France">Constitution of the Fifth Republic</a>, the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_senate">president of the senate</a> assumes the nation's presidential powers and duties following the president's death or resignation, and becomes interim Head of State until the next election.
Poher's first stint as interim president came on 29 April 1969, when <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> resigned. Previously he was one of de Gaulle's most notable political opponents and played a key role in the "no" success in de Gaulle's final referendum.
During his interim Presidency Poher continued to serve as Senate President. However, he resided during this time in the <a href="/wiki/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_Palace">Élysée Palace</a>.
Initially Poher tried to recruit General <a href="/wiki/Marie_Pierre_K%C5%93nig">Marie Pierre Kœnig</a> as a candidate for the Presidency and offered him his full support. Kœnig, however, declined to run, citing his poor health and stating that one general should not replace another general as the head of state.
After Kœnig's refusal, Poher himself announced his candidacy. Due to favourable polls he was viewed as the strongest opponent of <a href="/wiki/Georges_Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a> and the only non-<a href="/wiki/Gaullism">Gaullist</a> candidate who had a real opportunity to win the election. Lack of a longstanding party machine, however, hurt his chances.
During his short term in office Poher's main task was overseeing the incoming election, which he himself participated in. However during his tenure he took some major initiatives; for example, he fired longtime de Gaulle confidant <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Foccart">Jacques Foccart</a>, a Secretary-General for African Affairs and, unofficially, chief of the Gaullist secret services (he returned to the Élysée after Pompidou's election).
Poher also ordered the directors of France's state-controlled radio and television networks that public media to be politically neutral and not act in the interest of any particular party. His successors followed this precedent. He also ordered the redeployment of a large police force in Paris, staying after the May 1968 events.
During his tenure, Poher served with a Gaullist Government of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Couve_de_Murville">Maurice Couve de Murville</a>, de Gaulle's close ally. Some even referred to this period as the first <a href="/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)">cohabitation</a>. Despite sharp political differences, Poher was widely credited for model cooperation with the government.
Despite defeat in the election, due to his accomplishments, Poher, previously largely unknown to the public, developed a large popularity during the interim presidency.
He served again as Interim President in 1974 after Pompidou died in office. This time, however, he did not run for his own term and stepped down after <a href="/wiki/Val%C3%A9ry_Giscard_d%27Estaing">Valéry Giscard d'Estaing</a> was elected.
