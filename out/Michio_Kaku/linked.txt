It played theatrically in the United States, was later broadcast on national TV, and won several film awards. In 2005, Kaku appeared in the short documentary Obsessed & Scientific. The film is about the possibility of time travel and the people who dream about it. It screened at the Montreal World Film Festival and a feature film expansion is in development talks. Kaku also appeared in the ABC documentary <a href="/wiki/UFOs:_Seeing_Is_Believing" title="UFOs: Seeing Is Believing">UFOs: Seeing Is Believing</a>, in which he suggested that while he believes it is extremely unlikely that extraterrestrials have ever actually visited Earth, we must keep our minds open to the possible existence of civilizations a million years ahead of us in technology, where entirely new avenues of physics open up. He also discussed the future of interstellar exploration and alien life in the Discovery Channel special <a href="/wiki/Alien_Planet" title="Alien Planet">Alien Planet</a> as one of the multiple speakers who co-hosted the show, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity on The History Channel. In February 2006, Kaku appeared as presenter in the BBC-TV four-part documentary <a href="/wiki/Time_(television)" title="Time (television)" class="mw-redirect">Time</a> which seeks to explore the mysterious nature of time. Part one of the series concerns personal time, and how we perceive and measure the passing of time. The second in the series deal with cheating time, exploring possibilities of extending the lifespan of organisms. The geological time covered in part three explores the ages of the earth and the sun. Part four covers the topics of cosmological time, the beginning of time and the events that occurred at the instant of the big bang. On January 28, 2007, Kaku hosted the Discovery Channel series <a href="/wiki/2057_(TV_series)" title="2057 (TV series)">2057</a>. This three-hour program discussed how medicine, the city, and energy could change over the next 50 years.

On December 1, 2009, he began hosting a 12-episode weekly TV series for the Science Channel at 10 pm, called <a href="/wiki/Sci_Fi_Science:_Physics_of_the_Impossible" title="Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible">Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible</a>, based on his best-selling book. Each 30-minute episode discusses the scientific basis behind imaginative schemes, such as time travel, parallel universes, warp drive, star ships, light sabers, force fields, teleportation, invisibility, death stars, and even superpowers and flying saucers. Each episode includes interviews with the world's top scientists working on prototypes of these technologies, interviews with sci-fi fans, clips from science fiction movies, and special effects and computer graphics. Although these inventions are impossible today, the series discusses when these technologies might become feasible in the future. In 2010, he began to appear in a series on the website <a href="/wiki/Gametrailers.com" title="Gametrailers.com" class="mw-redirect">Gametrailers.com</a> called Science of Games, discussing the scientific aspects of various popular video games such as <a href="/wiki/Mass_Effect_2" title="Mass Effect 2">Mass Effect 2</a> and <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed" title="Star Wars: The Force Unleashed">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</a>. Kaku is popular in mainstream media because of his knowledge and his accessible approach to presenting complex subjects in science. While his technical writings are confined to theoretical physics, his public speaking and media appearances cover a broad range of topics, from the <a href="/wiki/Kardashev_scale" title="Kardashev scale">Kardashev scale</a> to more esoteric subjects such as <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormholes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" title="Time travel">time travel</a>. In January 2007, Kaku visited <a href="/wiki/Oman" title="Oman">Oman</a>. While there, he talked at length to select members of that country's decision makers. In an interview with local media, Dr Kaku elaborated on his vision of mankind's future. Kaku considers <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> as serious threats in man's evolution from a Type 0 civilization to Type 1.

Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including the <a href="/wiki/Anthropogenic" title="Anthropogenic" class="mw-redirect">anthropogenic</a> cause of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_armament" title="Nuclear armament" class="mw-redirect">nuclear armament</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and the general misuse of science. He was critical of the <a href="/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens" title="Cassini–Huygens">Cassini–Huygens</a> <a href="/wiki/Space_probe" title="Space probe">space probe</a> because of the 72 pounds (33 kg) of <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> contained in the craft for use by its <a href="/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" title="Radioisotope thermoelectric generator">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a>. Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe's fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a 'sling-shot' maneuver around earth, Kaku publicly criticized NASA's risk assessment. He has also spoken on the dangers of <a href="/wiki/Space_debris" title="Space debris">space junk</a> and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the exploration of outer space, believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in <a href="/wiki/Extrasolar_planet" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planets</a>; but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>. Kaku credits his anti-nuclear <a href="/wiki/War" title="War">war</a> position to programs he heard on the <a href="/wiki/Pacifica_Radio" title="Pacifica Radio">Pacifica Radio</a> network, during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of nuclear weapons in association with <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a> and focused on research, teaching, writing and media. Kaku joined with others such as <a href="/wiki/Helen_Caldicott" title="Helen Caldicott">Helen Caldicott</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Schell" title="Jonathan Schell">Jonathan Schell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peace_Action" title="Peace Action">Peace Action</a> and was instrumental in building a global anti-nuclear weapons movement that arose in the 1980s, during the administration of US President <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>.

His remark from an interview in support of <a href="/wiki/SETI" title="SETI" class="mw-redirect">SETI</a>, "We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation...and we wouldn't even know.", is used in the third <a href="/wiki/Symphony_of_Science" title="Symphony of Science">Symphony of Science</a> installment "Our Place in the Cosmos".Kaku is married to Shizue Kaku and has one daughter.
