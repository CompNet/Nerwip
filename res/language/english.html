		<h1>Presentation</h1>
		<i>EntityEditor</i> is a software developped to ease the manual annotation of named entities, 
		as well as to visualize named entities identified automatically by named entity detection tools.
		This software is meant to be used jointly with <i>Nerwip</i>i>, a plateform allowing to integrate any
		named entity detection tool and to evaluate it.
		<br/>
		This document describes the basis of its use. Note these instructions focus on using the menus, 
		but all the main features are also available through the toolbar buttons.
		
		
		<h1>Startup and options</h1>
		At the first launch, <i>EntityEditor</i> asks the user to indicate his name and the path of the corpus main folder,
		which contains all the texts to be annotated or visualized. This name will be use during the manual annotation:
		<i>EntityEditor</i> will record it in the XML file containing the created annotations, in order to easily
		correct systematic errors that can occur when several persons annotate a corpus. Both pieces of information
		(name and corpus folder) can be changed later, by using the <i>Options</i> menu.
		<br/>
		By default, at each startup, the software tries to reload the last loaded article, and to go to the last selected corpus
		folder. The user chan change this in the <i>Options</i> menu.
		<br>
		The <i>Options</i> menu also lets the user change the language used in the graphical interface. Note this does not
		change the keyboard shortcuts, and requires to restart the software.
		<br/> 
		By default, it is possible to edit the reference text. These modifications are automatically applied to the positions
		of the existing entities, both those manually annotated and those estimated by named entity detection tools. This feature
		can be disabled in the <i>Options</i> menu, in order to avoid accidentally changing a text.
		
		
		<h1>Navigation</h1>
		As previously mentioned, the user can switch to another corpus folder through the
		<i>Options</i> menu. The software then automatically loads the first article in the new corpus.
		From the <i>File</i> menu, the user can then select another article, either by directly loading it, 
		or by going to the next/previous article.
		<br/>
		The same <i>File</i> menu also allows recording the modications performed on the text or annotations, 
		recording the annotations in a new file, and quitting the software. The <i>Generate article list</i>
		option allows to generate a CSV file (i.e. one which can be opened Excel or a similar software) listing
		the articles from the corpus which have already (or currently are being) annotated, and the concerned editor
		(person having annotated or currently annotating them).
		<br/>
		In the main panel of the software, several tabs display different annotations. Those associated to the
		<i>Reference</i> tab correspond to the those manually defined. The other tabs display results
		obtained through different name entity detection tools, and are not editable. Any text modification
		of the reference is nevertheless applied to the annotations presented in the other tabs.
		<br/>
		The status bar (bottom of the window) displays the following details (in this order):
		<ul>
			<li>Parameters of the NER tool whose tab is currently selected (or nothing for the reference).</li>
			<li>Number of the current article in the corpus.</li>
			<li>Name of the current editor (person annotating the articles).</li>
			<li>Name of the editor who annotated the current article (or nothing if not annotation was performed before).</li>
			<li>Position of the cursor in the article, expressed in characters.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h1>Entities</h1>
		For more readability, each entity type is associated to a unique color, used in every GUI component
		related to this type control or display. First, entities are highlighted using this color in the text.
		Each type can be hidden, independently from the others, from the <i>View</i>  menu.
		When a type is hidden, it cannot be treated anymore: one cannot create any new annotation of this type,
		ore remove any existing ones.
		<br/>
		Entities are created by selecting the appropriate text and using the <i>Edition</i> menu. The concerned
		text is then highlighted using the type color, in order to indicate the presence of an entity. In order
		to remove an entity, one put the cursor inside it, or select a part of the entity, and use the <i>Edition</i>
		menu.
		<br/>
		It is also possible to shift the entities by one character on the left or on the right, still using the
		<i>Edition</i> menu. This shift applies only to the entities located after the current position of the
		cursor. The entities whose types are hidden are not affected by the shift. 
		<br/>
		<b>Warning: </b>when two annotations overlap, one may hide the other. It still exists though, as one can check
		in the corresponding XML file.  
		
		
		<h1>Display</h1>
		Besides displaying/hiding entities depending on their type, it is also possible to change other visual aspects.
		The <i>View</i> menu first allows increasing/decreasing the size of the font used to display the text. It also
		lets the user show/hide hypertext links of the document (providing it contains some hyperlinks).
		<br/>
		The <i>View</i> menu finally has an option allowing to switch between two types of highlight colors with different meaning. 
		They can either represent entity types (as described before), or compare entities estimated by some named entity
		detection tool and the reference ones. These three colors have the following meanings:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Green</i> for the parts of estimated annotations which are consistent with the reference (true positives),</li>
			<li><i>Yellow</i> for those existing in the estimation, but not in the reference (false positives),</li>
			<li><i>Red</i> for those existing in the reference but not in the estimation (false negatives).</li>
		</ul>
		The goal of this last option is to allow an easy quick visual comparison between results and reference,
		and to make differences appear clearly.
