Albert&#160 ; [PER Einstein  ] ( ; [MISC German:  ] &#160 ; ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955 ) was a [MISC German-born  ] theoretical physicist who developed the theory of general relativity , effecting a revolution in physics . For this achievement , [PER Einstein  ] is often regarded as the father of modern physics and one of the most prolific intellects in human history . He received the 1921 [ORG Nobel Prize in Physics  ] " for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect " . The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory within physics . Near the beginning of his career , [PER Einstein  ] thought that [MISC Newtonian  ] mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field . This led to the development of his special theory of relativity . He realized , however , that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields , and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916 , he published a paper on the general theory of relativity . He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light . In 1917 , [PER Einstein  ] applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole . He was visiting the [LOC United States  ] when [PER Adolf Hitler  ] came to power in 1933 , and did not go back to [LOC Germany  ] , where he had been a professor at the [ORG Berlin Academy of Sciences  ] . He settled in the [LOC U.S.  ] , becoming a citizen in 1940 . On the eve of [MISC World War II  ] , he helped alert President [PER Franklin D. Roosevelt  ] that [LOC Germany  ] might be developing an atomic weapon , and recommended that the [LOC U.S.  ] begin similar research ; this eventually led to what would become the [ORG Manhattan Project  ] . [PER Einstein  ] was in support of defending the Allied forces , but largely denounced using the new discovery of nuclear fission as a weapon . Later , together with [PER Bertrand Russell  ] , [PER Einstein  ] signed the [PER Russell–Einstein Manifesto  ] , which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons . [PER Einstein  ] was affiliated with the [ORG Institute for Advanced Study  ] in [LOC Princeton  ] , [LOC New Jersey  ] , until his death in 1955 . [PER Einstein  ] published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works . His great intelligence and originality have made the word " [PER Einstein  ] " synonymous with genius . [PER Albert Einstein  ] was born in [LOC Ulm  ] , in the Kingdom of [LOC Württemberg  ] in the [LOC German Empire  ] on 14&#160 ; March 1879 . His father was [PER Hermann Einstein  ] , a salesman and engineer . His mother was . In 1880 , the family moved to [LOC Munich  ] , where his father and his uncle founded Elektrotechnische [ORG Fabrik J.  ] [PER Einstein  ] &amp ; Cie , a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current . The [MISC Einsteins  ] were non-observant [MISC Jews  ] . [PER Albert  ] attended a [MISC Catholic  ] elementary school from the age of five for three years . Later , at the age of eight , [PER Einstein  ] was transferred to the [LOC Luitpold Gymnasium  ] where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left [LOC Germany  ] seven years later . Although it has been thought that [PER Einstein  ] had early speech difficulties , this is disputed by the [PER Albert Einstein Archives  ] , and he excelled at the first school that he attended . His father once showed him a pocket compass ; [PER Einstein  ] realized that there must be something causing the needle to move , despite the apparent " empty space " . As he grew , [PER Einstein  ] built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics . When [PER Einstein  ] was ten years old [PER Max Talmud  ] ( later changed to [PER Max Talmey  ] ) , a poor [MISC Jewish  ] medical student from [LOC Poland  ] , was introduced to the [PER Einstein  ] family by his brother , and during weekly visits over the next five years he gave the boy popular books on science , mathematical texts and philosophical writings . These included [PER Immanuel Kant  ] 's [ORG Critique of Pure Reason  ] and [ORG Euclid  ] 's Elements ( which [PER Einstein  ] called the " holy little geometry book " ) . In 1894 , his father 's company failed: direct current ( [ORG DC  ] ) lost the War of Currents to alternating current ( [ORG AC  ] ) . In search of business , the [PER Einstein  ] family moved to [LOC Italy  ] , first to [LOC Milan  ] and then , a few months later , to [LOC Pavia  ] . When the family moved to [LOC Pavia  ] , [PER Einstein  ] stayed in [LOC Munich  ] to finish his studies at the [LOC Luitpold Gymnasium  ] . His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering , but [PER Einstein  ] clashed with authorities and resented the school 's regimen and teaching method . He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning . In the spring of 1895 , he withdrew to join his family in [LOC Pavia  ] , convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor 's note . During this time , [PER Einstein  ] wrote his first scientific work , " The Investigation of the State of [LOC Aether  ] in [LOC Magnetic Fields  ] " . [PER Einstein  ] applied directly to the Eidgenössische [PER Polytechnische Schule  ] ( [ORG ETH  ] ) in [LOC Zurich  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] . Lacking the requisite [MISC Matura  ] certificate , he took an entrance examination , which he failed , although he got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics . The [MISC Einsteins  ] sent [PER Albert  ] to [LOC Aarau  ] , in northern [LOC Switzerland  ] to finish secondary school . While lodging with the family of Professor [PER Jost Winteler  ] , he fell in love with [PER Winteler  ] 's daughter , [PER Marie  ] . ( His sister [PER Maja  ] later married the Wintelers' son , [PER Paul  ] . ) In [LOC Aarau  ] , [PER Einstein  ] studied [PER Maxwell  ] 's electromagnetic theory . At age 17 , he graduated , and , with his father 's approval , renounced his citizenship in the [LOC German Kingdom  ] of [LOC Württemberg  ] to avoid military service , and in 1896 he enrolled in the four year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the [ORG Polytechnic  ] in [LOC Zurich  ] . [PER Marie Winteler  ] moved to [LOC Olsberg  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] for a teaching post . [PER Einstein  ] 's future wife , [PER Mileva Marić  ] , also enrolled at the [ORG Polytechnic  ] that same year , the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course . Over the next few years , [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Marić  ] 's friendship developed into romance , and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which [PER Einstein  ] was taking an increasing interest . In 1900 [PER Einstein  ] was awarded the [ORG Zurich Polytechnic  ] teaching diploma , but [PER Marić  ] failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component , theory of functions . There have been claims that [PER Marić  ] collaborated with [PER Einstein  ] on his celebrated 1905 papers , but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions . In early 1902 , [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Mileva Marić  ] ( [ORG Милева Марић  ] ) had a daughter they named [PER Lieserl  ] in their correspondence , who was born in [LOC Novi Sad  ] where [PER Marić  ] 's parents lived . Her full name is not known , and her fate is uncertain after 1903 . [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Marić  ] married in January 1903 . In May 1904 , the couple 's first son , [PER Hans Albert Einstein  ] , was born in [LOC Bern  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] . Their second son , [ORG Eduard  ] , was born in [LOC Zurich  ] in July 1910 . In 1914 , [PER Einstein  ] moved to [LOC Berlin  ] , while his wife remained in [LOC Zurich  ] with their sons . [PER Marić  ] and [PER Einstein  ] divorced on 14 February 1919 , having lived apart for five years . [PER Einstein  ] married [PER Elsa Löwenthal  ] ( née [PER Einstein  ] ) on 2 June 1919 , after having had a relationship with her since 1912 . She was his first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally . In 1933 , they emigrated permanently to the [LOC United States  ] . In 1935 , [PER Elsa Einstein  ] was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems and died in December 1936 . After graduating , [PER Einstein  ] spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post , but a former classmate 's father helped him secure a job in [LOC Bern  ] , at the [ORG Federal Office for Intellectual Property  ] , the patent office , as an assistant examiner . He evaluated patent applications for electromagnetic devices . In 1903 , [PER Einstein  ] 's position at the [ORG Swiss Patent Office  ] became permanent , although he was passed over for promotion until he " fully mastered machine technology " . Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time , two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led [PER Einstein  ] to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time . With a few friends he met in [LOC Bern  ] , [PER Einstein  ] started a small discussion group , self-mockingly named " The [ORG Olympia Academy  ] " , which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy . Their readings included the works of [PER Henri Poincaré  ] , [PER Ernst Mach  ] , and [PER David Hume  ] , which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook . In 1901 , [PER Einstein  ] had a paper on the capillary forces of a straw published in the prestigious [MISC Annalen  ] der [ORG Physik  ] . On 30 April 1905 , he completed his thesis , with [PER Alfred Kleiner  ] , Professor of [ORG Experimental Physics  ] , serving as pro-forma advisor . [PER Einstein  ] was awarded a PhD by the [ORG University of Zurich  ] . His dissertation was entitled " A New Determination of [ORG Molecular Dimensions  ] " . That same year , which has been called [PER Einstein  ] 's annus mirabilis or " miracle year " , he published four groundbreaking papers , on the photoelectric effect , [ORG Brownian  ] motion , special relativity , and the equivalence of matter and energy , which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world . By 1908 , he was recognized as a leading scientist , and he was appointed lecturer at the [ORG University of Bern  ] . The following year , he quit the patent office and the lectureship to take the position of physics at the [ORG University of Zurich  ] . He became a full professor at [ORG Karl-Ferdinand University  ] in [LOC Prague  ] in 1911 . In 1914 , he returned to [LOC Germany  ] after being appointed director of the [ORG Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics  ] ( 1914–1932 ) and a professor at the [ORG Humboldt University of Berlin  ] , with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations . He became a member of the [ORG Prussian Academy of Sciences  ] . In 1916 , [PER Einstein  ] was appointed president of the [ORG German Physical Society  ] ( 1916–1918 ) . In 1911 , he had calculated that , based on his new theory of general relativity , light from another star would be bent by the [ORG Sun  ] 's gravity . That prediction was claimed confirmed by observations made by a [MISC British  ] expedition led by Sir [PER Arthur Eddington  ] during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 . International media reports of this made [PER Einstein  ] world famous . On 7 November 1919 , the leading [MISC British  ] newspaper The [MISC Times  ] printed a banner headline that read: " Revolution in [LOC Science&#160  ] ; – New Theory of the Universe&#160 ; – [ORG Newtonian Ideas Overthrown  ] " . ( Much later , questions were raised whether the measurements had been accurate enough to support [PER Einstein  ] 's theory . ) . In 1921 , [PER Einstein  ] was awarded the [ORG Nobel Prize in Physics  ] . Because relativity was still considered somewhat controversial , it was officially bestowed for his explanation of the photoelectric effect . He also received the [ORG Copley Medal  ] from the [ORG Royal Society  ] in 1925 . [PER Einstein  ] visited [LOC New York City  ] for the first time on 2 April 1921 , where he received an official welcome by the Mayor , followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions . He went on to deliver several lectures at [ORG Columbia University  ] and [ORG Princeton University  ] , and in [LOC Washington  ] he accompanied representatives of the [ORG National Academy of Science  ] on a visit to the [LOC White House  ] . On his return to [LOC Europe  ] he was the guest of the [MISC British  ] statesman and philosopher [PER Viscount Haldane  ] in [LOC London  ] , where he met several renowned scientific , intellectual and political figures , and delivered a lecture at [LOC Kings College  ] . In 1922 , he traveled throughout [LOC Asia  ] and later to [LOC Palestine  ] , as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour . His travels included [LOC Singapore  ] , [LOC Ceylon  ] , and [LOC Japan  ] , where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of [MISC Japanese  ] . His first lecture in [LOC Tokyo  ] lasted four hours , after which he met the emperor and empress at the [LOC Imperial Palace  ] where thousands came to watch . [PER Einstein  ] later gave his impressions of the [MISC Japanese  ] in a letter to his sons::307 " Of all the people I have met , I like the [MISC Japanese  ] most , as they are modest , intelligent , considerate , and have a feel for art . " :308 . On his return voyage , he also visited [LOC Palestine  ] for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region . " He was greeted with great [MISC British  ] pomp , as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist " , writes [PER Isaacson  ] . This included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the [MISC British  ] high commissioner , Sir [PER Herbert Samuel  ] . During one reception given to him , the building was " stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him " . In [PER Einstein  ] 's talk to the audience , he expressed his happiness over the event: . In 1933 , [PER Einstein  ] decided to emigrate to the [LOC United States  ] due to the rise to power of the [LOC Nazis  ] under [LOC Germany  ] 's new chancellor , [PER Adolf Hitler  ] . While visiting [MISC American  ] universities in April , 1933 , he learned that the new [MISC German  ] government had passed a law barring [MISC Jews  ] from holding any official positions , including teaching at universities . A month later , the [MISC Nazi  ] book burnings occurred , with [PER Einstein  ] 's works being among those burnt , and [MISC Nazi  ] propaganda minister [PER Joseph Goebbels  ] proclaimed , " [MISC Jewish  ] intellectualism is dead . " [PER Einstein  ] also learned that his name was on a list of assassination targets , with a " $5 , 000 bounty on his head . " One [MISC German  ] magazine included him in a list of enemies of the [MISC German  ] regime with the phrase , " not yet hanged " . [PER Einstein  ] was undertaking his third two-month visiting professorship at the [ORG California Institute of Technology  ] when [PER Hitler  ] came to power in [LOC Germany  ] . On his return to [LOC Europe  ] in March 1933 he resided in [LOC Belgium  ] for some months , before temporarily moving to [LOC England  ] . He took up a position at the [ORG Institute for Advanced Study  ] at [LOC Princeton  ] , [LOC New Jersey  ] , an affiliation that lasted until his death in 1955 . He was one of the four first selected ( two of the others being [PER John von Neumann  ] and [PER Kurt Gödel  ] ) . At the institute he soon struck up a close friendship with [PER Gödel  ] . [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Gödel  ] would take long walks together discussing their work . His last assistant was [PER Bruria Kaufman  ] , who later became a renowned physicist . During this period [PER Einstein  ] tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully . Other scientists also fled to [LOC America  ] . Among them were [MISC Nobel laureates  ] and professors of theoretical physics . With so many other [MISC Jewish  ] scientists now forced by circumstances to live in [LOC America  ] , often working side by side , [PER Einstein  ] wrote to a friend , " For me the most beautiful thing is to be in contact with a few fine [MISC Jews—a  ] few millennia of a civilized past do mean something after all . " In another letter he writes , " In my whole life I have never felt so [MISC Jewish  ] as now . " . In 1939 , a group of [MISC Hungarian  ] scientists that included [MISC Hungarian  ] emigre physicist [PER Leó Szilárd  ] attempted to alert [LOC Washington  ] of ongoing [MISC Nazi  ] atomic bomb research . The group 's warnings were discounted . [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Szilárd  ] , along with other refugees such as [PER Edward Teller  ] and [PER Eugene Wigner  ] , " regarded it as their responsibility to alert [MISC Americans  ] to the possibility that [MISC German  ] scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb , and to warn that [PER Hitler  ] would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon . " :630 In the summer of 1939 , a few months before the beginning of [MISC World War II  ] in [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Einstein  ] was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing a letter with [PER Szilárd  ] to President [PER Franklin D. Roosevelt  ] to alert him of the possibility . The letter also recommended that the [LOC U.S.  ] government pay attention to and become directly involved in uranium research and associated chain reaction research . The letter is believed to be " arguably the key stimulus for the [LOC U.S.  ] adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the [LOC U.S.  ] entry into [MISC World War II  ] " . President [PER Roosevelt  ] could not take the risk of allowing [PER Hitler  ] to possess atomic bombs first . As a result of [PER Einstein  ] 's letter and his meetings with [PER Roosevelt  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] entered the " race " to develop the bomb , drawing on its " immense material , financial , and scientific resources " to initiate the [ORG Manhattan Project  ] . It became the only country to develop an atomic bomb during [MISC World War II  ] . For [PER Einstein  ] , " war was a disease.. . [ and ] he called for resistance to war . " But in 1933 , after [PER Hitler  ] assumed full power in [LOC Germany  ] , " he renounced pacifism altogether.. . In fact , he urged the [MISC Western  ] powers to prepare themselves against another [MISC German  ] onslaught . " :110 In 1954 , a year before his death , [PER Einstein  ] said to his old friend , [PER Linus Pauling  ] , " I made one great mistake in my life&#160 ; — when I signed the letter to President [PER Roosevelt  ] recommending that atom bombs be made ; but there was some justification&#160 ; — the danger that the [MISC Germans  ] would make them.. . " . [PER Einstein  ] became an [MISC American  ] citizen in 1940 . Not long after settling into his career at [LOC Princeton  ] , he expressed his appreciation of the " meritocracy " in [MISC American  ] culture when compared to [LOC Europe  ] . According to [PER Isaacson  ] , he recognized the " right of individuals to say and think what they pleased " , without social barriers , and as result , the individual was " encouraged " to be more creative , a trait he valued from his own early education . [PER Einstein  ] writes: . What makes the new arrival devoted to this country is the democratic trait among the people . No one humbles himself before another person or class.. . [MISC American  ] youth has the good fortune not to have its outlook troubled by outworn traditions.:432 . As a member of the [ORG National Association  ] for the Advancement of [ORG Colored People NAACP  ] at [LOC Princeton  ] who campaigned for the civil rights of [MISC African Americans  ] , [PER Einstein  ] corresponded with civil rights activist [PER W. E. B. Du Bois  ] , and in 1946 [PER Einstein  ] called racism [LOC America  ] 's " worst disease " . He later stated , " Race prejudice has unfortunately become an [MISC American  ] tradition which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next . The only remedies are enlightenment and education " . After the death of [LOC Israel  ] 's first president , [PER Chaim Weizmann  ] , in November 1952 , Prime Minister [PER David Ben-Gurion  ] offered [PER Einstein  ] the position of President of [LOC Israel  ] , a mostly ceremonial post . The offer was presented by [LOC Israel  ] 's ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Abba Eban  ] , who explained that the offer " embodies the deepest respect which the [MISC Jewish  ] people can repose in any of its sons " .:522 However , [PER Einstein  ] declined , and wrote in his response that he was " deeply moved " , and " at once saddened and ashamed " that he could not accept it: . All my life I have dealt with objective matters , hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official function . I am the more distressed over these circumstances because my relationship with the [MISC Jewish  ] people became my strongest human tie once I achieved complete clarity about our precarious position among the nations of the world.:522 . On 17 April 1955 , [PER Albert Einstein  ] experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm , which had previously been reinforced surgically by Dr. [PER Rudolph Nissen  ] in 1948 . He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the [ORG State of Israel  ] 's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital , but he did not live long enough to complete it . [PER Einstein  ] refused surgery , saying: " I want to go when I want . It is tasteless to prolong life artificially . I have done my share , it is time to go . I will do it elegantly . " He died in [LOC Princeton Hospital  ] early the next morning at the age of 76 , having continued to work until near the end . During the autopsy , the pathologist of [LOC Princeton Hospital  ] , [PER Thomas Stoltz Harvey  ] , removed [PER Einstein  ] 's brain for preservation without the permission of his family , in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made [PER Einstein  ] so intelligent . [PER Einstein  ] 's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location . In his lecture at [PER Einstein  ] 's memorial , nuclear physicist [PER Robert Oppenheimer  ] summarized his impression of him as a person: " He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness.. . There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn . " . Throughout his life , [PER Einstein  ] published hundreds of books and articles . In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the [LOC Bose–Einstein  ] statistics , the [PER Einstein  ] refrigerator and others . The [PER Annus Mirabilis  ] papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect ( which gave rise to quantum theory ) , [ORG Brownian  ] motion , the special theory of relativity , and E = mc2 that [PER Albert Einstein  ] published in the [MISC Annalen  ] der [ORG Physik  ] scientific journal in 1905 . These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of and changed views on space , time , and matter . The four papers are: . [PER Albert Einstein  ] 's first paper submitted in 1900 to [MISC Annalen  ] der [ORG Physik  ] was on capillary attraction . It was published in 1901 titled Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen , which was translated as " Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena " . Two papers he published in 1902–1903 ( thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view . These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on [ORG Brownian  ] motion . These published calculations ( 1905 ) showed that [ORG Brownian  ] movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist . His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena . He articulated the principle of relativity . This was understood by [PER Hermann Minkowski  ] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time . Other principles postulated by [PER Einstein  ] and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number . [PER Einstein  ] 's " Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper " ( " On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies " ) was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year . It reconciles [PER Maxwell  ] 's equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics , by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light . This later became known as [PER Einstein  ] 's special theory of relativity . Consequences of this include the time-space frame of a moving body slowing down and contracting ( in the direction of motion ) relative to the frame of the observer . This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether&#160 ; – one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time&#160 ; – was superfluous . In his paper on mass–energy equivalence [PER Einstein  ] produced E&#160 ; =&#160 ; mc2 from his special relativity equations . [PER Einstein  ] 's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was accepted by leading physicists , starting with [PER Max Planck  ] . In a 1905 paper , [PER Einstein  ] postulated that light itself consists of localized particles ( quanta ) . [PER Einstein  ] 's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists , including [PER Max Planck  ] and [PER Niels Bohr  ] . This idea only became universally accepted in 1919 , with [PER Robert Millikan  ] 's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect , and with the measurement of [LOC Compton  ] scattering . [PER Einstein  ] concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each , where h is [PER Planck  ] 's constant . He does not say much more , because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave . But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the photoelectric effect . In 1907 [PER Einstein  ] proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator . In the [PER Einstein  ] model , each atom oscillates independently – a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator . [PER Einstein  ] was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different , but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics . [PER Peter Debye  ] refined this model . Throughout the 1910s , quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems . After [PER Ernest Rutherford  ] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets , [PER Niels Bohr  ] was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by [PER Planck  ] and developed by [PER Einstein  ] would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms , and the periodic table of the elements . [PER Einstein  ] contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [PER Wilhelm Wien  ] had made . [PER Wien  ] had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process . [PER Einstein  ] noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant . [PER Arnold Sommerfeld  ] identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics . The law that the action variable is quantized was a basic principle of the quantum theory as it was known between 1900 and 1925 . Although the patent office promoted [PER Einstein  ] to [ORG Technical Examiner Second Class  ] in 1906 , he had not given up on academia . In 1908 , he became a privatdozent at the [ORG University of Bern  ] . In " über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das [ORG Wesen und  ] die Konstitution der [MISC Strahlung  ] " ( " The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation " ) , on the quantization of light , and in an earlier 1909 paper , [PER Einstein  ] showed that [PER Max Planck  ] 's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent , point-like particles . This paper introduced the photon concept ( although the name photon was introduced later by [PER Gilbert N. Lewis  ] in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics . [PER Einstein  ] returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations , giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point . Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density . At the critical point , this derivative is zero , leading to large fluctuations . The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered , making the fluid look milky white . [PER Einstein  ] relates this to [LOC Raleigh  ] scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength , and which explains why the sky is blue . [PER Einstein  ] quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and [PER Rayleigh  ] scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter . [PER Einstein  ] 's physical intuition led him to note that [PER Planck  ] 's oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point . He modified [PER Planck  ] 's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to hf , to half the energy spacing between levels . This argument , which was made in 1913 in collaboration with [PER Otto Stern  ] , was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms . General relativity ( [ORG GR  ] ) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by [PER Albert Einstein  ] between 1907 and 1915 . According to general relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses . General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics . It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes , regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape . As [PER Albert Einstein  ] later said , the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory , while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . So in 1908 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity . In that article , he argued that free fall is really inertial motion , and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply . This argument is called the Equivalence principle . In the same article , [PER Einstein  ] also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation . In 1911 , [PER Einstein  ] published another article expanding on the 1907 article , in which additional effects such as the deflection of light by massive bodies were predicted . While developing general relativity , [PER Einstein  ] became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory . He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible . He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only . In June , 1913 the Entwurf ( " draft " ) theory was the result of these investigations . As its name suggests , it was a sketch of a theory , with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions . Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity , after more than two years of intensive work [PER Einstein  ] abandoned the theory in November , 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken . In 1917 , [PER Einstein  ] applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole . He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging , but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity . To fix this , [PER Einstein  ] modified the general theory by introducing a new notion , the cosmological constant . With a positive cosmological constant , the universe could be an eternal static sphere . [PER Einstein  ] believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred , because it would obey [PER Mach  ] 's principle . He had shown that general relativity incorporates [PER Mach  ] 's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields , but he knew that [PER Mach  ] 's idea would not work if space goes on forever . In a closed universe , he believed that [PER Mach  ] 's principle would hold . [PER Mach  ] 's principle has generated much controversy over the years . In 1917 , at the height of his work on relativity , [PER Einstein  ] published an article in [LOC Physikalische Zeitschrift  ] that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser . This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with [PER Planck  ] 's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode . This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws . [PER Einstein  ] discovered [PER Louis de Broglie  ] 's work , and supported his ideas , which were received skeptically at first . In another major paper from this era , [PER Einstein  ] gave a wave equation for de [PER Broglie  ] waves , which [PER Einstein  ] suggested was the [MISC Hamilton–Jacobi  ] equation of mechanics . This paper would inspire [PER Schrödinger  ] 's work of 1926 . In 1924 , [PER Einstein  ] received a description of a statistical model from [MISC Indian  ] physicist [PER Satyendra Nath Bose  ] , based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles . [PER Einstein  ] noted that [PER Bose  ] 's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles , and submitted his translation of [PER Bose  ] 's paper to the [ORG Zeitschrift  ] für [ORG Physik  ] . [PER Einstein  ] also published his own articles describing the model and its implications , among them the [LOC Bose–Einstein  ] condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [PER Eric Allin Cornell  ] and [PER Carl Wieman  ] using ultra-cooling equipment built at the [LOC NIST–JILA  ] laboratory at the [ORG University of Colorado  ] at [LOC Boulder  ] . Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons . [PER Einstein  ] 's sketches for this project may be seen in the [PER Einstein  ] Archive in the library of the [ORG Leiden University  ] . General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime , so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum . [PER Noether  ] 's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a [MISC Lagrangian  ] with translation invariance , but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry . The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by [PER Noether  ] 's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason . [PER Einstein  ] argued that this is true for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates . He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field . This approach has been echoed by [PER Lev Landau  ] and [PER Evgeny Lifshitz  ] , and others , and has become standard . The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [PER Erwin Schrödinger  ] and others . Following his research on general relativity , [PER Einstein  ] entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity . In 1950 , he described his " unified field theory " in a [MISC Scientific American  ] article entitled " On the [ORG Generalized Theory of Gravitation  ] " . Although he continued to be lauded for his work , [PER Einstein  ] became increasingly isolated in his research , and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful . In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces , [PER Einstein  ] ignored some mainstream developments in physics , most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces , which were not well understood until many years after his death . Mainstream physics , in turn , largely ignored [PER Einstein  ] 's approaches to unification . [PER Einstein  ] 's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory , where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting . [PER Einstein  ] collaborated with others to produce a model of a wormhole . His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations , in line with the program outlined in the paper " Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the [ORG Elementary Particles  ] ? " . These solutions cut and pasted [PER Schwarzschild  ] black holes to make a bridge between two patches . If one end of a wormhole was positively charged , the other end would be negatively charged . These properties led [PER Einstein  ] to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way . In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity , the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the torsion . This modification was made by [PER Einstein  ] and [PER Cartan  ] in the 1920s . The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law &#160 ; – the [PER Einstein  ] equations which describe how space curves , the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the [PER Einstein  ] equations . Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear , a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields , like a black hole , would move on a trajectory which is determined by the [PER Einstein  ] equations themselves , not by a new law . So [PER Einstein  ] proposed that the path of a singular solution , like a black hole , would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself . This was established by [PER Einstein  ] , [PER Infeld  ] , and [PER Hoffmann  ] for pointlike objects without angular momentum , and by [PER Roy Kerr  ] for spinning objects . [PER Einstein  ] conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned . These pertain to force , superconductivity , gravitational waves , and other research . Please see the main article for details . In addition to long time collaborators [PER Leopold Infeld  ] , [PER Nathan Rosen  ] , [PER Peter Bergmann  ] and others , [PER Einstein  ] also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists . [PER Einstein  ] and [PER De Haas  ] demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons , nowadays known to be the spin . In order to show this , they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum . They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate , because the electron 's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes . This experiment needed to be sensitive , because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small , but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization . [PER Einstein  ] suggested to [PER Erwin Schrödinger  ] that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [LOC Bose–Einstein  ] gas by considering a box . Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator . Quantizing these oscillators , each level will have an integer occupation number , which will be the number of particles in it . This formulation is a form of second quantization , but it predates modern quantum mechanics . [PER Erwin Schrödinger  ] applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas . [PER Schrödinger  ] urged [PER Einstein  ] to add his name as co-author , although [PER Einstein  ] declined the invitation . In 1926 , [PER Einstein  ] and his former student [PER Leó Szilárd  ] co-invented ( and in 1930 , patented ) the [PER Einstein  ] refrigerator . This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input . On 11 November 1930 , was awarded to [PER Albert Einstein  ] and [PER Leó Szilárd  ] for the refrigerator . Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production , as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the [MISC Swedish  ] company [ORG Electrolux  ] to protect its refrigeration technology from competition . The [LOC Bohr–Einstein  ] debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between [PER Albert Einstein  ] and [PER Niels Bohr  ] who were two of its founders . Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science . In 1935 , [PER Einstein  ] returned to the question of quantum mechanics . He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other . He noted , along with his collaborators , that by performing different measurements on the distant particle , either of position or momentum , different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way . He then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined . The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be , without in any way disturbing the particle , then the particle actually has values of position or momentum . This principle distilled the essence of [PER Einstein  ] 's objection to quantum mechanics . As a physical principle , it was shown to be incorrect when the [ORG Aspect  ] experiment of 1982 confirmed [PER Bell  ] 's theorem , which had been promulgated in 1964 . [PER Albert Einstein  ] 's political views emerged publicly in the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and reputation for genius . [PER Einstein  ] offered to and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics . ( see main article ) . [PER Einstein  ] 's views on religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings . These views covered theological determinism , agnosticism , humanism along with ethical culture , opting for [PER Spinoza  ] 's god over belief in a personal god . [PER Albert Einstein  ] once pointed out that [MISC Buddhism  ] was the tradition that he felt fulfilled the criteria he thought necessary for a spiritual path adapted to the twentieth century . . While travelling , [PER Einstein  ] wrote daily to his wife [PER Elsa  ] and adopted stepdaughters [PER Margot  ] and [PER Ilse  ] . The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The [ORG Hebrew University  ] . [PER Margot Einstein  ] permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public , but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death ( she died in 1986 ) . [PER Barbara Wolff  ] , of [ORG The Hebrew University  ] 's [PER Albert Einstein  ] Archives , told the [ORG BBC  ] that there are about 3 , 500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 . [PER Einstein  ] bequeathed the royalties from use of his image to [ORG The Hebrew University of Jerusalem  ] . [ORG Corbis  ] , successor to The [PER Roger Richman Agency  ] , licenses the use of his name and associated imagery , as agent for the university . In the period before [MISC World War II  ] , [PER Einstein  ] was so well known in [LOC America  ] that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain " that theory " . He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries . He told his inquirers " Pardon me , sorry ! Always I am mistaken for Professor [PER Einstein  ] . " . [PER Einstein  ] has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels , films , plays , and works of music . He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated . TIME magazine 's [PER Frederic Golden  ] wrote that [PER Einstein  ] was " a cartoonist 's dream come true " . [PER Einstein  ] merited awards and honors , including the [ORG Nobel Prize in Physics  ] . Please see main article . [PER Josiah Willard Gibbs  ] ( 1901 ) &#160 ; · .
